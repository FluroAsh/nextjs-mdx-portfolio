# Project coding standards for TypeScript and React

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Keep components small, modular and focused
- Use Tailwind CSS for component styling
- Use React Query for data fetching and state management
- Prefer using Atomic Design principles for component structure
