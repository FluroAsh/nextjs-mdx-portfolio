# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions

- Use **PascalCase** for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use **camelCase** for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use **kebab-case** for file names (e.g., `my-component.tsx`, `my-component.test.tsx`)

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Code structure

- Organize code into modules and directories based on functionality
- Use index files to simplify imports
- Keep related files together (e.g., component, styles, tests)
- Create reusable helper functions where appropriate
- Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions
