## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works, where appropriate based on component type:
  - Arrow keys for navigation
  - Spacebar/enter for selection
  - Escape for cancelliation/closing
  - Tab for focus traversal
  - Shift+Tab for reverse focus traversal
- Use proper color contrast ratios
