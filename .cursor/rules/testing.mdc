# Unit & End-to-End Testing

- Use Vitest for unit testing
- When creating tests, ensure mock data is used and/or created as needed
  - If possible ensure that mock data can be re-used across different test suites
- Use Playwright for testing end-to-end user flows
- Provide clear and readable test names and descriptions

## Restrictions

- Only add unit tests when explicitly requested by the user
