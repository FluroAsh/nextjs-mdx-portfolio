## Key Features

- **MDX Blog System**: Multi-part blog series with photo gallery
- **ContentLayer (contentlayer2) Integration**: Type-safe content management
- **Image Lightbox**: Interactive photo viewing with collections
- **Series Navigation**: Multi-part content with navigation
- **Tag System**: Content categorization and filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **SEO Optimization**: Metadata and structured data

## Code Guidelines

1. **Component Organization**: Group related components together
2. **Accessibility**: Always include proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support
   - Assume Radix/Shadcn UI components will be used in most cases, and therefore should be accessibility by default
3. **Type Safety**: Always provide proper TypeScript types for utility functions
4. **Error Handling**: Include try-catch blocks for utilities that perform I/O operations
5. **Pure Functions**: Keep utilities pure and side-effect free when possible
6. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for complex utility functions
7. **Reusability**: Check existing utilities before creating new ones
8. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and naming conventions

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Use union types for content variants (`Blog`, `BlogSeries`)
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Follow App Router conventions and patterns
- Use proper SEO metadata and structured data

### Content Management

- Use ContentLayer for type-safe content
- Implement proper slug generation
- Handle draft content appropriately
- Use proper date formatting and sorting

## File Naming Conventions

- Components: kebab-case (e.g., `post-layout.tsx`)
- Hooks: kebab-case starting with 'use' (e.g., `use-range-scroll.ts`)
- Utilities: kebab-case (e.g., `format-date.ts`)
- Types: kebab-case (e.g., `blog-content.ts`)
- Constants: kebab-case (e.g., `site-config.ts`)
- Generated files: Store in `.generated/` folder (excluded from git)
  - This is to be used for AI generated files that are not to be committed to the repository
  - For example when the user asks you to generate a plan for a new feature, writing prompts or similar content that is not to be committed to the repository

## Import Organization

- React/Next.js imports first
- Third-party library imports second
- Internal imports last (components, utils, types)
- Use import aliases from `src/` when possible
- Refer to `.prettierrc` for the import order and sorting rules

## Content Guidelines

- Blog posts use MDX format with frontmatter
- Images stored in S3 with proper optimization
- Use proper alt text for accessibility
- Implement proper image captions and collections
- Support for video content with custom components

## Performance Considerations

- Prefer to use the custom image components over the Next.js image component
  - `
- Implement proper loading states
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with proper tree shaking
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Common Patterns

- Use the compound component pattern for complex UI
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo and React.useCallback for performance optimization when heavy compute/re-renders are expected
- Implement proper loading states
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

## ContentLayer Configuration

- Blog posts support series grouping
- Proper slug generation for routing
- Draft content filtering
- Date-based sorting and filtering
- Tag-based content organization

## Image Handling

- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Implement lightbox functionality
- Support for image collections
- Proper responsive image sizing

## SEO and Metadata

- Implement proper meta tags
- Use structured data for content
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

When working on this project:

1. Follow the established patterns and conventions
2. Maintain type safety throughout
3. Ensure responsive design works on all devices
4. Test accessibility features
5. Optimize for performance
6. Use proper error handling
7. Follow Next.js best practices
8. Maintain clean, readable code
