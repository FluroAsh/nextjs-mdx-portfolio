## Tokyo (5 days)

The start of our journey kicked off with a flight from Melbourne to Tokyo aboard Philippine Airlines, the flight itself is about 12 hours long,
but including the 8 hour layover in Manila we spent closer to 20 hours neither in Melbourne or Tokyo, hooray for the airport lounge
we managed to book! 🫠 I don't think I would have survived without the buffet and a comfortable chair to have a snooze in. 😴

After the very long layover and "short" 4-hour flight, we finally arrived at Haneda Airport and took a taxi to a hotel which we could recharge at, about 10 minutes away.
Although let me tell you, it took us a good 20 minutes to figure out which one of the many levels of the airport we actually needed to be at so we could
get a taxi (without being ripped off). 😅

Once we arrived at our overnight hotel, we checked in and caught up on some much-needed sleep — light outs!

The next day, we woke up early to catch a shuttle bus back to Haneda Airport and hop on a train — despite expecting warm Spring weather,
we were instead greeted with a brief snowy morning and grey skies all around. 🌨️

### Akihabara

After being dropped off at Haneda Airport, we took some time to get our [Suica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suica) cards (a prepaid card for public transport) and then hopped on the
train to Akihabara, the famous district known for its electronics shops, anime, manga culture, and maid cafes (this particular one was actually a male maid cafe)... 😳🚆

  alt="Akihabara Male Maid Cafe"

Getting to Akihabara was a breeze, the train system in Tokyo is very efficient and easy to navigate (with a bit of a helping hand from Google Maps).
We arrived at Akihabara station, and with our luggage in hand, we set off to venture around and find a storage shop to drop off our bags.

<LightboxImage

  alt="Akihabara Station"
  caption="Akihabara Station"
/>

We search for a good 30 minutes, walking around circles with our heads buried into Google maps before finally spotting a tiny opening in a shopping strip
just across from the local starbucks, it was random tech repair shops and other weird gizmos...
But there it was, a storage shop! We hand over our bags to the old Japanese man and hope they're still there when we get back... Arigato gozaimasu! 🙏😅

Of course, now being nearly 1:30PM, we _had_ to cross the street and check into Starbucks after only living off airplane coffee and airplane food for the 24 hours — _WE NEEDED COFFEE!_ 🤯☕️

<LightboxImage

  alt="Akihabara Station Starbucks"
  caption="Akihabara Station Starbucks"
/>

Now refuled and our veins pumped with caffeine, we head off into search of a place to eat lunch.
After a bit of searching on Google Maps, and walking around, we find a small Gyukatsu restaraunt located down some stairs which lead us into
the basement level of a building, it was called [Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066443-d14028838-Reviews-Gyukatsu_Motomura_Akihabara-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) (牛カツ もと村).

<LightboxImage

  alt="Gyukatsu Set"
  caption="Gyukatsu Motomura"
/>

We order a Gyukatsu set, which is a breaded and deep-fried beef cutlet served with:

- A side of rice
- Red miso soup (slightly stronger than your typical miso soup)
- Shredded cabbage
- [Grated yam](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tororo_(food)>) (Tororo)
- [Warabimochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warabimochi) (sweet Mochi like dessert from the [Kansai region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region))
- Various sauces and condiments

One of the best things about Japan is that you get wasabi with (almost) everything, given I'm always getting like 3 extra packets of wasabi whenever
ordering sushing In Australia, I was a happy boy. 😍

The gyukatsu we had provided prepared raw, so you could cook it the way god intended (medium-rare) on a hot stone until
mouth wateringly juicy — what a great way to start our trip! 😏

{/* Wondering around Akihabara... */}
After our lunch we set out to adventure around [Akihabara electric town](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html), where we admired the unique architecture, bright fluroescent colours and bustling atmopshere — this is the
central hub for anime, manga and gaming culture in Japan, we made sure to make the most of it and stop along the endless rows of manga, retro gaming & anime shops
along the way.

<LightboxImage

  alt="Akihabara Streets with Taxi's"
/>

The weather was finally starting to clear up, and even the sun was coming out to say hello, so I did what any good tourist would do and I took some photos of unique streets and buildings
around me — I even managed to snap a photo of some little tiny Uber cars driving around.

I didn't know it at the time, but these little cars are actually fully licensed taxis in Japan.
They are called ["JPN Taxi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_JPN_Taxi) and are designed to be compact, accessible (for its aging population) as-well as efficient for navigating the narrow streets of Japan — fun fact, they were also designed after
[London's black cabs](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/29/the-new-japan-taxi-from-toyota-wants-to-be-an-international-icon/). 🚕🇬🇧

  alt="GiGO Akihabara 4 Building"
/>

While making our way towards Don Quiijote, we stumbled spot one of the many [GiGO](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GENDA_GiGO_Entertainment) around Akihabara, this one was GiGO Akihabara no. 4. It's a known popular arcade chain in Japan
filled with arcade games and claw machines — claw machines being the main speciality of this particular store, ever since it was sold off by [SEGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega) in 2020.

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-07/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-07.webp"
  alt="Don Quijote Akihabara"
  caption="Don Quijote Akihabara"
/>

Finally we arrive at the main destination for the day, the famous [Don Quijote](https://www.donki.com/en/) store in Akihabara.
We're greeted by the iconic yellow and red sign, and the store's mascots, a penguin named "Donpen" (ドンペン) with his pink companion "Donko" (ドンキョン) 🐧 — they're both symbols of the store's quirky and playful atmosphere.

We have a bit of a browse around the store, and I manage to find a few things that look pretty interesting, _HEAPS_, of anime anod manga merchandise across the eight total floors in the store.
Ultimately though, we leave empty handed as we didn't want to get too crazy on the first day of our trip, and we still had so much more to see! (Spoiler alert — we load up on goodies in [Osaka](#osaka-3-days) anyway 🛍️😂)...

With that out of our system, we head on back to pick up our luggage from the storage shop, and make our way back towards Akihabara station to get one last coffee fix, and a quick snack before heading to our hotel in Asakusa.

Our coffee shop of choice this time was Sarutahiko Coffee, a popular coffee shop in Akihabara right beside Akihabara station.

<LightboxImage

  alt="Sarutahiko Coffee"
/>

The _final_ stop! We couldn't resist grabbing one of Cow Cow Kitchen's famous “Milk Pies” — a creamy Hokkaido milk-filled pastry wrapped in golden, flaky crust. 😏 While it's a bit of a
cult favorite in Japan (especially among dessert lovers and tourists), it's still a hidden gem outside the country.

Safe to say... worth... every... bite. 🐮

### Asakusa

We finally hop onto the train and make our way to Asakusa after a long day, on the way we see the [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree) in the distance — we never do make it there,
but it's still a landmark to admire and take in, plus I've got proof I was (nearly) there! 😅

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-19/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-19.webp"
  alt="Tokyo Skytree"
/>

We make our way towards our hotel in Asakusa, a quaint little place called [T-Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/t-qian-cao.en-gb.html) tucked away in a quiet seemingly residential area with plenty of non-descript little traditional Japanese restaraunts hidden away.
Many of these restaraunts often do not take reversations or accept foreigners, as we were soon to find out! But more on that later... 😉

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-21/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-21.webp"
  alt="Asakusa Backstreets"
  caption="Asakusa Backstreets"
/>

Coming face-to-face with our hotel, we see just how small things can really get in Tokyo. Even though it's 6 stories tall, the building looks like it's only about 5 meters wide.

The entire room was extremely narrow, with 2 rooms on each of the 6 floors, it was giving me the same vibes we had in Hong Kong with how compact everything was, albeit _slightly_ more spacious when taking into account the bathroom... 😅

      caption: "Our homebase for the next 3 days",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Senso-ji

Once we finish checking into our hotel, and taking a moment to rest our little feet, we throw our luggage into the corner and head out to **Senso-ji Temple** to have a
look around the markets, and take some pictures before nightfall settles in.

Our hotel was conveniently about a 10 minute walk from the temple, making our first destination of the trip super easy to get to.

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-22/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-22.webp"
  alt="Crossing Opposite Senso-ji Temple"
/>

Crossing the road, we get our first glimpse of the main temple, it's referred to as Kannon-dō (観音堂) or Hondō (本堂) and it is the main hall of Senso-ji Temple, which is dedicated to the [bodhisattva Kannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin) (観音), the goddess of mercy and compassion.

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-23/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-23.webp"
  alt="Senso-ji Main Temple"
  caption="Hondō (本堂)"
/>

Often in travel videos and photos you just see the main shopping street with the gate pictured in the background, but what don't see it just how large the
entire temple complex really is, with the main hall being surrounded by a large courtyard and many other smaller shrines and buildings scattered around the area.

      alt: "Hondō (本堂) at Asakusa Shrine with Senso-ji Pagoda ",
    },
  ]}
/>

A short walk from the main hall, we also stumble to a very small shrine called [Asakusa Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa_Shrine) (浅草神社), which is a Shinto shrine located within the Senso-ji Temple complex.

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-29/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-29.webp"
  alt="Hondō Front Entrance"
/>

Heading on over towards the inner temple grounds facing the main hall, you can see the giant washi paper lantern hanging from the roof which sits directly infront of the
offering boxes, where you can throw in a coin(s) and make a wish. Generally you would also bow _and_ clap your hands twice, and finally bow once more to show respect to the gods.

    },

/>

[Hōzōmon Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dz%C5%8Dmon) (宝蔵門), meaning "Treasure House Gate," serves as the imposing inner gate of Sensō-ji Temple, positioned between Nakamise-dōri and the main hall.
Originally built in the 10th century and reconstructed multiple times, the current reinforced concrete structure dates to 1964 after being destroyed in World War II.
The gate is architecturally more imposing than Kaminarimon, featuring thicker pillars and housing the temple's sacred texts and treasures on its second, which is how it earned its name "Treasure House Gate".

The gate is accompanied by two massive [Niō guardian](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_(Buddhism)>) statues (Kongōrikishi) symbolizing protection against evil, while a large red chōchin lantern bearing "Kobunachō" (小舟町)
hangs above the central passage, donated by the town of the same name. Two bronze lanterns sit on either side, and behind the gate hangs a large waraji (straw sandal),
traditionally believed to ward off evil spirits. This fortified entrance serves as the symbolic threshold between the commercial bustle of Nakamise street and the sacred temple grounds.

  alt="Nakamise Shopping Street"
  caption="Nakamise (仲見世通り) Shopping Street"

As we stroll through the iconic **Hōzōmon Gate**, we cross into the famous [Nakamise Shopping Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens%C5%8D-ji#Nakamise-d%C5%8Dri) (仲見世通り),
a vibrant and bustling street lines with shops selling traditional snacks, souvenirs and crafts.

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-36/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-36.webp"
  alt="Nakamise Street Surrounded by Shopping Stalls"
/>

With the sun setting and stores closing soon, we decided to soak in the atmosphere of one of Japan's oldest shopping streets, saving the shopping for later.
Dating back to the 12th century, this 250-meter path leading to Sensō-ji Temple was bustling with crowds — a classic part of the cherry blossom season experience in Japan. 😅

The street blends tradition and modernity, with Edo-style wooden shopfronts mixed alongside bright neon signs, making you feel like you've stepped back in time.
While it felt a bit touristy, we enjoyed the unique vibe. A few shops were crafting traditional Geta (下駄) sandals and selling Yukata (浴衣),
but most were geared towards snacks and souvenirs—it's a bit of a known tourist trap, but it was still cool to walk through it from start to finish.

Making our way through to the end of Nakamise Street, we finally arrived at the iconic **Kaminarimon Gate**

<LightboxImage
  src="https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-38/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-38.webp"
  alt="Kaminarimon Gate"
  caption="Kaminarimon Gate (雷門)"
/>

[Kaminarimon Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaminarimon), or "Thunder Gate", stands as the iconic outer entrance to Sensō-ji Temple and ranks among Tokyo's most photographed landmarks.
Originally built in 941 AD and relocated to its current Asakusa location in the early 17th century, the gate features a massive 3.9-meter tall red lantern weighing around 700kg, displaying the characters "雷門" (Thunder Gate).
Standing inside the gate are statues of Fūjin (god of wind) and Raijin (god of thunder), symbolizing protection and good fortune.

The famous washi paper lantern, stretched over a bamboo frame, gets replaced approximately every ten years due to weathering and is temporarily lifted during festivals to allow tall floats to pass underneath.
Kaminarimon stays busy throughout the day as a common meeting point for tours, and continues to stay busy late into the evening as Nakamise street comes alive, serving as a beautiful backdrop for photos when
illuminated against the night sky. The gate serves as a gateway into the bustling heart of Asakusa with many shops and stalls nearby, and providing access to other strees and laneways.

Doing a quick 180° turn, we find ourselves on **Kaminarimon-dori Street** (雷門通り), the main street leading from Kaminarimon Gate to Sensō-ji Temple. As you walk down this street,
you'll spot the iconic [Asahi Breweries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Breweries) headquarters building with its famous "Golden Flame" sculpture on its roof, often humorously referred to as the "Golden Poo" (金色のうんこ) by locals. 💩

<LightboxImage

  alt="Kaminarimon-dori Street"
  caption="Kaminarimon-dori Street (雷門通り)"
/>

The street is lined with various shops, restaurants, and stalls, making it a great place to explore if you're hunting for souvenirs, local snacks, or a place to grab a bite to eat.

Much of the architecture along the street is tradtiional, with wooden shopfronts, lanterns and the occasional rickshaw with passengers being pulled along the street by a local guide — it's
a great little place to explore at night, with the mix of both traditional and modern architecture really capturing the sprit of Asakusa.

As we walk through Nakamise Street, we notice that there's actually a few shopping streets that connected to it, one of which is the (very long) [Shin-Nakamise Shopping Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-Nakamise_d%C5%8Dri) (新仲見世通り),
which we didn't know at the time, but would be coming back through here the next day to grab some breakfast and taiyaki! 🐟

We take the chance to get some night-time photos of the main hall and Hōzōmon Gate, which light up beautifully at night against the surrounding buildings caught in the shadows of the night sky.

We were originally thinking of having dinner at one of the traditional Japanese izakaya's nearby, our first night of looking for a restaraunt in Asakusa was a bit of a challenge though, we got the "Gaijin" (foreigner) treatment at a few places, where they either didn't want to serve us or were "fully booked" out.
So we fallback to Plan B as the sun had well and truly headed to sleep by this point... 👇

Ya'll already know I'm about that konbini life! In the end, we made a beeline for the nearest Lawson and loaded up on the essentials... Fried chicken, onigiri (rice balls), and a dangerously creamy pudding for dessert.
Honestly, nothing hits the spot after a long day of exploring like a late-night konbini haul. With a full stomach and zero regrets, I was out like a light before I could even finish any more pudding... 😴

### Team Lab Borderless

Before heading out to our main destination of the day, we head out on an adventure to find some breakfast in **Asakusa**.

We venture down to [Orange Street](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/473414/orange-street), a hidden gem in Asakusa, known for its
retro Showa-era charm and local atmosphere — you'll find less tourists around here, with more locals shoppping around, and enjoying the local cafes. It's only a short walk from Senso-ji Temple,
making it a great place to start your day before heading to the other parts of Tokyo.

We ended up strolling past a small taiyaki shop called [Naruto Taiyaki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M833WG4BmsifvtFi7) which is famous for its fish-shaped cakes filled with sweet red bean paste,
though you can also get them filled with custard, chocolate, or other fillings — it was nice to start the day with something sweet and warm! The word "Taiyaki" literally means
"baked sea bream" in Japanese, as the shape of the cake resembles a sea bream fish. 🐟

The final result, a delicious fish-shaped cake filled with sweet red bean paste, with the carbs and sugar flowing through my veins, I was ready to take wait in line for my next
meal of the day... 😼

Making our way through [Shin-Nakamise Shopping Street](https://tokyotourists.com/nakamise-shopping-street/) we find ourselves a descreit little
cafe called [Cafe Tomorrow Asakusa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vkcJG1H17J1wbX1x6) which is a classic kissaten, literally meaning "tea-drinking shop".
It's Showa-era vibes and retro decor make it a time capsule back into the 80's, when the cafe originally opened. They traditionally serve coffee, tea, light meals and deserts,
and are well known for their cosy and relaxed atmosphere where you can enjoy a leisurely break from city, and the huge amounts of tourists engulfing Tokyo this time of year.

We enjoyed a cafe latte, with their famous **Corn Mayo Toast** which had a generous spread of sweet corn kernels mixed in with a generous swirl
of mayonnaise on top of a Japanese levels thick, slice of toast, served with a side of soft scrambled egg, miso soup and a small shredded cabbage salad.

After finishing up breakfast, we got a wiggle on and got on our way to meet up with our friends who also happened to be in **Asakusa** at the same time, and would join us an our adventure for the
rest of the day!

We hopped on the train towards **Ginza**, where we would venture out to have lunch at a popular gyūtan (beef tongue) restaurant called [Negishi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mbrHPwGnQHBp49AHA) at Ginza 3-Chome.
Navigating through the busy shopping streets of Ginza, we find the restaraunt just off the main street, tucked underneath some stairs — there was a bit of a queue,
but it moved quickly, and it was going to be worth the wait!

I end up going for the gyūtan set meal, which came with:

- Beef tongue slices
- Barley rice
- Mini curry (with small slice of beef tongue)
- Small green salad w/ Mayo

I of course _had to_ get a lemon sour (lemon-flavoured shōchū) to wash it all down. 🍋 I would highly recommend trying it if you're in the area, it's a really unique
blend of flavours, with the tender, smokey grilled beef tongue, paired with the nutty barley rice and the rich, slightly spicy curry sauce.

After refueling for the afternoon, we set off and hopped back on the train headeding towards **Kamiyacho Station**, where we would take a short walk to [Azubadai Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bM75bzZ4VNqgWhpy5),
which is a pretty large shopping complex that also houses the famous [Team Lab Borderless](https://borderless.teamlab.art/) exhibition — our next stop!

Our friends did a bit of shopping before we headed into the exhibition, we even got a super freshly made chocolate chip cookie from one of the little shops inside! 🍪 With the sugar kick out of the way, and shopping done,
we headed inside to grab our ticket and dive into some new worlds!

<LightboxImage

  alt="Team Lab Borderless Entrance"
/>

Walking through the winding hallways inside the exhibition, we were met with different themed rooms, each showcasing various digital art pieces that moved and changed over time, some of them even
in response to movement and touch, allowing you to feel like you were a part of the artwork itself.

The common theme throughout the exhibition was elements of nature, water, flowers and animals, all brought to life as you walk through the different rooms and corridors.

One of the most interesting things you can do in this particular Team Lab's exhibition is create your own sketches and have them scanned in, and brought to life on the walls
inside the **Sketch Ocean** room, where if you're unlucky they might be swept up by one of the sharks patrolling the walls! The Japanese manga characters floating around are sure to
remind you you're in Japan. 🤣

Entering into the [Infinite Crystal World](https://www.teamlab.art/ew/crystalworld-azabudai/tokyo/) you really feel like you've stepped into a different dimension, where there's an endless expanse of mirrors and lights stretching out in every direction, only
broken up by a very small walkway created by the lights draped from the ceiling.

<LightboxImage

  alt="Room with mirrors and long light ropes hanging from the ceiling"

Making it out of the first section, you walk into a much larger room, also being an endless expanse of mirrors and the lights you walked through reflecting off every surface — looking down at the floor,
you can see see yourself staring back at you! 👀

{/* "Bubble Universe" - https://www.teamlab.art/ew/bubbleuniverse-azabudai/tokyo/ */}

The next room was very similar and named , except this time it was fileld with large, glowing balls of light that floated around the room, reflected off the mirrors all around you, make you feel like you're floating
in a sea of bubbles. 🫧

After playing in the proverbial bubble bath, we found ourselves in a different universe, this time one filled with cubes bigger than me! The cubes have
blue streams of light flowing down them, and would react to you if you got close enough, moving and flowing around you as if you water standing underneath a waterfall. ☂️

One of the other rooms we wondered into was filled with mist, there were projections of people (and animals? 🤔) with instruments playing music, if felt like you were walking into a dream — the dark
room made it difficult to see where the walls ended, making it feel like you were stuck in a never-ending void of mist and light. 😶‍🌫️

You can see it in motion in the video below, it's a super weird feeling when you first step into the room.

As we make our way closer to the end of the exhibition, we find a room filled wall to ceiling with a really interesting art piece, the feature being what looks like a giant tree log
wrapped with various colours of snakes, all moving and writhing around the log in a hypnotic fashion.

<LightboxImage

Walking around the corner, we walk our way to the exclusive Cafe [EN TEA HOUSE](https://en-tea-house.teamlab.art/azabudai/) which is a part of the Team Lab Borderless exhibition, but requires you to order your choice of tea before entering,
you also had the option to pair specific teas with a milk gelato. We had to wait for our turn before we could take our seats, but the vibe inside was dreamlike, with soft music playing in the background,
and what looks like a tea science experiment, being illuminated by a warm glow of different colours.

<LightboxImage

The highlight video below really captures the essence of the experience, with projections being cast onto the tea bowls, and the tables all around the room.

Once seated, we were eventually served our teas, I went for the **Barley Tea Rice Milk Latte** which had a roasted and slightly nutty flavour from the barley, paired with the creamy and slightly
sweet rice milk.

The tea bowl itself was a simple glass bowl, but the real magic happened when the tea was poured in, and the digital art projections follow the movement of the bowl, changing and morphing over
time until you eventually finished your tea. 🍵

It was a really unique experience you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else, even with the _many_ tea-houses in Japan, highly recommend if you're in **Tokyo**!

But with the halls of **Team Lab Borderless** thoroughly explored, we made our way back out into the real world through the exit, which was filled with
various plaques with different quotes about art, life and the universe.

{/* Dinner */}

Starting from the lively Azabudai Hills complex in central Tokyo, we took a short stroll to **Kamiyacho Station** on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. From there, it was just a few stops
to **Hatchobori Station.** Emerging in the heart of **Chuo City**, we walked a few minutes to [Yakitori Torikizoku Hatchobori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DPNirNwui9DjRiCq5)—ready to chow
down on some long overdue Yakitori!

We ordered a bunch of different Yakitori skewers to share, the highlights were definitely the grilled chicken thighs, pork belly and the more premium
wagyu beef skewers which were melt-in-your-mouth tender, smokey, and paired perfectly with a cold glass of beer. 🍺

  alt="Assortment of Yakitori Skewers"
/>

For desert me and **Yuki** both got some mochi ice-cream, I went for the soy flavour as I wanted to try something a bit different, while she went for the classic
strawberry flavour. The soy had a subtle sweetness to it, when mixed with the chewy mochi skin and the cold ice-cream in the center it really came together
as a unique combination of creaminess, sweetness, and the slightly savoury flavour of the soy.

Wrapping up dinner for the night, we headed back towards Azabudai Hills as we were booked in for a visit to the top of **Tokyo Tower** later that night — our friends stopped at
Ginza to do some late-night shopping, so we said our goodbyes and continued on our way! 🚆

Now getting arriving at **Kamiyacho Station** once again, we set off a a hunt for more coffee, leading us back towards Azabudai Hills! We found a quite popular
coffee shop called [% Arabica](https://arabica.com/en/location/arabica-tokyo-azabudai-hills-b1/), it was originally founded in Hong Kong in 2013, however Kyoto is considered
the birthplace and location of its global flagship headquarters.

We sat down to enjoy our coffess and the unique atmosphere of the shop, with the white stone countertops, walls and flooring, the entire shop glowed with a soft white light,
it made you feel like you were in coffee heaven! 😇

With coffee flowing through our veins, we made our way back outside into the cool night air, and headed towards **Tokyo Tower** which was only a short walk away.

### Tokyo Tower

Day 3

### Shinjuku

- Heading to Shinjuku
- Lumine Est shopping mall
  - We dropped in at [KOMERAKU](https://www.lumine.ne.jp/est/floorguide/detail/?scd=002413) — "A Luxurious Day for Ochazuke" (こめらく 贅沢な、お茶漬け日和。),
    a cozy ochazuke spot in Shinjuku that lets you start with a seafood rice bowl and then pour steaming dashi over it mid-meal for a second experience.
- Hopped on the Yamanote line to Shibuya

### Shibuya

- Got off the train to arrive at Shibuya station

  - Very crowded and busy, but we managed to find out way out
  - We were immediately greeted by the famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, absolutely packed with all sorts of people in every direction
  - It was like being thrown into a sea of people after exiting the confined space isnide the train station

- We then headed towards the famous [Meiji Jingu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Jingu) (明治神宮) shrine, which is a Shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken.

  - Walked through the park leading up to the shrine
  - As we arrived we were greeted by the large wooden Torii gates at the entrance
  - The shrine is located in a large forested area, providing a peaceful escape from the bustling city.
  - We walked through the beautiful forested area leading to the shrine, which was a nice contrast to the busy streets of Shibuya.
  - A peaceful escape from the bustling city, surrounded by a serene forested area
  - Shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken
  - Traditional Shinyo wedding ceremony

- Shibuya Scramble Square
  - If you're a Netflix binge watcher like me, you might recognise the iconic crossing from the opening scene of the show ["Alice in Borderland"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Borderland_(TV_series)>)
    where the main characters find themselves in a deserted Shibuya after a mysterious event. 😅
- Hachikō statue
- Searching for extremely elusive manga volume for my brother, visited a few stores
  - [Mandarake](https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/?lang=en) (まんだらけ) — a famous chain of stores in Japan that specializes in second-hand manga, anime, and video games.
  - [Animate](https://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/corner/cc/anion_info_zh/cd/929/) (アニメイト) — a popular retail chain in Japan that specializes in anime, manga, and related merchandise.
- But didn't find the specific manga he was looking for: ("The Climber")
- Instead we settled for some crepes from a nearby shop instead called "Dipper Dan"
  - I got a bannana crepe, while Yuki got a matcha one with some tiny little brownie pieces on top
- It was at this point the sun was starting to set, so we decided to look for a place for dinner. We settled on a small
  ramen shop called Kamakura ramen, which was tucked away in one of the little alleyways in Shibuya.
  - This was very fitting, as we were going to Kamakura the next day!
- We then headed back to Shibuya station to catch the train back to Asakusa, and catch up on some rest!

### Kamakura

Day 4

- Great Buddha of Kamakura
- Train ride to Kamakura station
- Heading to Enoshima Island
  - Enoshima Shrine
  - Crispy octopus cracker
  - Hokkaido milk & soda ice-cream
  - Local squirrel resident
- Tsurugaoka Hachimangu (Shinto Shrine)
- Quick walk into Komachi-dori street
  - Got some matcha ice-cream
  - Walked back to the bus
- Late night bus ride back to Shinjuku (3 hours aprox.)
- We arrved back in Shinjuku in the evening, with the bus rid giving us plenty of time to rest our feet (and stomachs) before getting dinner!
- With a quick Google search, and tempura on our minds, we scrambled to find a place to eat.
- After about a 15 minute walk, we dipped and climbed our way down some stairs into the basement of the Shinjuku Nomura building,
  where we ducked into the warmly lit corner marked by white noren curtains and the scent of deep-fried perfection: [Tenkichiya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XpNNqT22jsGktW1B9).

  - **Tenkichiya** (天吉屋) is a small, cozy tempura restaurant located in the basement of the Shinjuku Nomura Building.
  - The atmopshere was very cosy, with a warm and inviting ambiance
  - I treated myself to a over-sized beer (compared to what I'm used to 😂) to wash down the delicious tempura
  - It was slightly nutty, crispy and light, with a perfect balance of flavors—not greasy at all! Easily oen of the best tempura I've ever had (so far)... 😏

- Now refueled, and stomachs full, we headed back to Shinjuku station to catch the Toei subway back to Asakusa.

## Kyoto (3 days)

{/* Day 1 */}

- The next morning we checked out and were off to Kyoto by Shinkansen from Tokyo station
- Fortunately for me, we managed to book ahead and bag the Mt. Fuji seats on the Shinkansen, which meant we had a great view of the mountain as we passed by it on our way to Kyoto! 🗻
- We quickly grabbed some food for the train ride over, just some simple chicken sando's and coffee from one of the little konbini's in the station — at this point I really wish we had
  these sandwiches back home in Australia. 😭
- Once the train departed, we settled in for the ride, and opened up our packed lunches as we were going to be pretty strapped from time once we arrived in Kyoto.
- About a 2 hour ride later onboard the [Nozomi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nozomi_(train)>) Shinkansen, we finally arrived at Kyoto station
- We hopped off the train and made our way to the Kyoto City Bus terminal, which was conveniently located right next to the station.

### Kiyomizu-dera

- We were off towards the famous [Kiyomizu-dera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizu-dera) (清水寺) temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most celebrated temples in Japan.

  - We took the Kyoto City Bus from Kyoto Station to Kiyomuzu-dera directly, which was about a 15 minute ride.
  - Getting off at [Gojozaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%8Dzaka) bus stop, with luggage in hand, we made our way towards the Kimono rental shop to pick up our outfits for the day.

- Kimono rental

  - The local kimono rental shop was called [MOCOMOCO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LWH9KkvsdwrfPiBc7), which is about a 10 minute walk from Kiyomizu-dera, and 2 minutes from
    Gojo-dori street which is filled with snack shops and little cafes.
  - On the way we grab some ice-cream soda and mochi, I was having dangerous amounts of sugar, but when in Japan... 😅

- Kiyomizu-dera Temple
- The name "Kiyomizu" means "clear water" in Japanese, and the temple is named after the Otowa Waterfall, which runs beneath the main hall.
- The temple is famous for its wooden stage that juts out over the hillside, offering stunning views of the cherry blossoms in spring and the vibrant foliage in autumn.
- The main hall (Hondō) is built without the use of nails, showcasing traditional Japanese wooden architecture.
- Kiyomizu-dera is also known for its "Kannon" deity, the goddess of mercy, and many visitors come to pray for good fortune and health.
- The temple complex includes several other shrines, pagodas, and gardens, making it a popular destination for both tourists and locals.
- The approach to the temple is lined with charming streets filled with traditional shops, tea houses, and stalls selling local crafts and snacks.
- Kiyomizu-dera is one of the most photographed landmarks in Kyoto, especially during the cherry blossom season when the temple is surrounded by blooming sakura trees
  - Which just so happens to be the time we were visiting! 🌸
- Sanju-no-to (Three-story pagoda)
- After spending the day exploring the temple, shops and getting a few snacks, we finally made our way back to the bus stop at Gojozaka, to catch a different bus that would take us to [Shijo Kawaramachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pQ78hS3dFW9yA3N48) right on **Kawaramachi Street**
  which was about a 5 minute walk to our hotel, [Kabin Kyoto](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298564-d28717057-Reviews-Kabin_Kyoto-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html).
- By the time we arrived at **Shijo Kawaramachi**, the sun was already starting to set, and the streets were starting to fill with people heading our for dinner and do some last minute shopping.
- The sunset was stunning, with the sky paints in hues of orange and pink, reflecting off the buildings and creating a day to remember for our first day in Kyoto.

{/* Hotel check-in */}

![Kabin Tokyo Entrance](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/kyoto/kyoto-13/large_kyoto-13.webp)

- Once we arrived at our hotel, we were greeted by the friendly staff who helped us check in, they were very friendly and must have been expats from other countries, as they seemed very familiar with the area, spoke perfect English
  and were very helpful in giving us recommendations for places to see and eat at during our few days in Kyoto.
- Our hotel room was _MUCH_ bigger than our previous one in Asakusa, it felt like a palace in comparison! 🤴
- With our luggage droppedd off, we freshed up and headed out to find some dinner, I had a bit of a craving for some Japanese sashimi & nagiri, so we set out to [Sushiro](https://akindo-sushiro.co.jp/en/) (スシロー) — a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain in Japan
  - The one we visited was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, down some stairs in the basement level. We just had to take a ticket, find a seat and wait for our number to be called.
  - It was fairly busy, which was a good sign, but people were moving through the line quite quickly, so my grumbling stomach didn't have to wait too long! 😅
  - We were seated down at a bench right beside the conveyor belt, and enjoyed the variety of sushi and sashimi, it was the freshest we had while in Japan, and easily the best value for money! 🍣
  - I yoinked myself an alcoholic grape soda to wash it all down 🍇 I was so sad that I never got a chance to have this again, we couldn't find it anywhere!
  - It was basically a strong zero, but with grape syrup instead of lemon, and it was so good! 😭
  - Coffee + crepes for desert
  - Highly, highly, highly recommend Sushiro if you're in town for some sushi, it was a really good balance of quality and price, and they often run seasonal specials & partnerships With
    well known anime and games, which is cool if you're into that culture! 😼
- ... ??
- Back to the hotel!

{/* Day 2 */}

### Heian-Jingu Shrine & Garden

- We decided today is the day for Japanese Maccas, so we headed over to the nearest one in Kyoto, which was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel
- I grab myself the legendary Teriyaki Chicken burger, and I couldn't turn down the seasonal cherry blossom pie to pair with my coffee either! 🌸

- For our next stop over to [Heian-Jingu Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_Jing%C5%AB) (平安神宮) we quickly pick up some onigiri (rice balls) for
  lunch from one of the extremely popular little food stalls on Kawaramachi Street, of course we went for the top 5 most popular flavours, which seems to be
  a very common thing to do in Japan when it comes to food 😂 Can't complain, it removes the need to use my noggin'—trust the locals! Or tourists?... 🤔
- From Kawaramachi Steet, we hopped on the Kyoto City Bus to **Heian-Jingu Shrine**, getting off at the stop just outside [ROHM Theatre Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHM_Theatre_Kyoto).
- Today just so happened that the day we visited there was seemingly a lot of students graduating from their classes. This area was a bit of a hotspot for students as it was nearby a few different academic
  institutions, including **Kyoto University** — the theatre often being used for graduation ceremonies, with heaps of different areas for students to take photos in their graduation gowns.
- This seemed to align with Kyoto University's graduation ceremony day, which happens to be between April & March each year, right in the midst of cherry blossom season! 🌸
- We walked through the main entrance gate into the courtyard, which was opened up to the public
- We took this time to find a place to sit and enjoy our onigiri, only realising you're not actualyl meant to eat in the shrine grounds 🤫 It's quite difficult to find a place to BYO lunch and eat.
- After finishing our lunch, we head towards the booth in the courtyard to buy our tickets to enter the shrine and gardens
- The entrance fee was 600 yen per person, which included access to the gardens and the main shrine hall, however the shrine was under renovations, so you couldn't fully appreciate it, as there was tarps
  covering the outside of the building, and much of the interior.
- ⚠️ Gardens area, large pond, walkway to second pond and stepping stones
- ⚠️ Main iconic pond area, with the iconic wooden bridge which was used as a set piece in the famous movie "Memoirs of a Geisha"
- At various parts of the garden, you can find small transitory sections which reflect the concept of "Ma" (間) — the Japanese aesthetic of negative space, which is often used in traditional Japanese gardens to create a sense of tranquility and harmony.
- This emphasizes the importance of balance and simplicity in Japanese design, allowing the natural beauty of the surroundings to shine through, allowing time to slow down and appreciate the moment and surrodunings.
- ⚠️ Some cherry blossoms were on display, but mostly were still buds, not fully bloomed yet — the weather was still a bit chilly at this point in our trip, causing them to be a bit late this year.
- After finishing up our
- ...
- Dinner at [Saryo Tesshin](https://tabelog.com/en/kyoto/A2601/A260202/26041180/) which was serving buckwheat soba noodles
  - I had soba which came with some very tender duck breast, accompanied by some freshly grated wasabi and a glass of beer on the side. 😏
- Heading back to the hotel, we stop at Nishiki Market (錦市場) to pick up a few more bites as Yuki was still a bit hungry (and she let me know it too! 🏃‍➡️)
  - Nishiki Market is a bustling food market in Kyoto, known for its wide variety of traditional Japanese foods and snacks.
  - We strolled through the narrow alleyways and caught a glimpse of some melon pan out of the corner of our eyes, matcha no less!
  - We couldn't resist, so we grabbed one to share and headed back to the hotel to rest our tired feet after a long day of exploring. 💤

{/* Part 3 */}

## Osaka (3 days)

- Checkout from our hotel
- Breakfast at granny's cafe
- Carried our luggage and headed to Gion-shijo station
- Took the train towards **Kyobashi**
- Switched to the **Osaka Metro Tanimachi** subway, getting off at **Higashi-Umeda**
- Walked from Higashi-Umeda to **Umeda station**, taking the **Midsouji Line** to **Nippombashi** station
- Finally, after lots of switching, we arrived at our stop.
- We walked to our hotel which was about a 10 minute walk from the station
- Stored our luggage at the hotel before check-in
- Went for lunch at a nearby Soba restaurant
  - [Teuchisoba Shuhari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PhiVkN52zLrBiuVJ8)
  - They specialise in buckwheat soba noodles served either hot or cold
  - We ordered some for ourselves, and as we couldn't get enough of it, a side of tempura to go with it!
- Afterwards we went across the street to have a look at the nearby [Kuromon Ichiba Market](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4031.html) which is well known as one of the most famous food markets in Osaka,
  where can find almost any type of food you can think of, from fresh seafood to grilled meats and local fruits.
- While walking through, we find some interesting looking white strawberries, which were quite expensive, so we paid our tourist tax and bought a skewer to try them out.
  - To be honest, they were a bit underwhelming after hearing about how good Japan's fruits are, they sort of just tasted liek normal strawberries, but just had a very different appearance. 🤷‍♂️
  - They might not have been in season yet, as it was still early in the year, so we might have to try them again next time we visit Japan! 🍓
- After having a short walk around the market, we head back to the hotel to check in and take the luggage upstairs into our room.
- Our room was on one of the higher floors, overlooking one of the busy streets in Osaka, it reminded me a bit of the streets of Tokyo, being raised above the ground and winding between buildings.

### "New World" District

{/* Tsutenkaku */}

- Having settled in, we make our way towards [Shinsekai "New World" District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsekai),literally meaning "New World" in Japanese, is a vibrant and
  nostalgic district in Osaka, known for its retro atmosphere, giant 3D signboards and unique blend of old and new.
- The district's sotuhern area was modelled after New York, specifically [Coney Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island), with mixtures of Western and Japanese culture.
- The northern part of the district being modelled after Paris, with the iconic [Tsutenkaku Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutenkaku) (通天閣) being the main attraction of the area, partially inspired
  by the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
  - The tower itself was originally built in 1912, but was severely damaged by a fire in 1943, being disassembled and used for steel during the war effort, later being rebuilt in 1956, becoming a symbol of Osaka's post-war recovery and growth.
- We took time to walk through the streets of Shinsekai, checking out the various shops, stalls and restaraunts in the southern end of the district, before making our way towards the Tsutenkaku Tower.
- The Tsutenkaku Tower is a symbol of Osaka, standing at 103 meters tall, and offers panoramic views of the city from its observation deck.
- We didn't go up to the observation deck this time, but instead opted to jump on the **tsutenkaku tower slide**
- You could instead do a "dive and walk" experience, when you walk up to the top of the tower, and then jump off one of the higher parts of the tower—we could only choose one, so we went for the slide instead!
- The slide was a fun experience, the weight took at-least 45 minutes to get through, but the short little ride down was still a lot of fun, it makes you feel like a kid again! 🛝
- After the slide, we headed back down into the streets of Shinsekai and started to think about what we wanted to gobble up for dinner!
- We ended up looking around for a place to eat, walking towards Dotonbori, ending up stumbling into a little gem of a restaraunt called [Fukutaro](https://2951.jp/en/#) which is famous for its okonomiyaki and negiyaki
  - Located just opposite **Kuromon Market**, this place _absolutely_ needs to be on your list if you're in Osaka! They have a few locations, but this is the main store.
  - Famous for **Negiyaki** — a thinner, lighter, savory pancake with lots of Japanese green leeks, soy sauce-based flavoring, and either beef, pork or seafood. (I got the beef one, it was _TOO_ good!)
  - Cooking style: Griddles are in full view — customers can watch chefs skillfully pour, flip, and plate the dishes right at the counter.
  - Atmosphere: Lively and intimate; seating is limited so expect queues during peak hours.
  - Popularity: Well-known among both locals and tourists, often ranked among the top okonomiyaki/negiyaki spots in Osaka.

### Dotonbori

{/* Dotonbori */}

- After wrapping up with dinner, we walked from Shinsekai to the famous [Dotonbori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori) district, which took about 15 minutes on foot, leading us to our next stop — desert!
- Walking through the neon-lit streets of Dotonbori, and some similar signs to those in Shinsekai, we found a cute little **melonpan** shop, which is a popular Japanese sweet bread with a crunchy cookie crust on top, often
  filled with ice-cream of various flavours
  - We got ourselves one to share, going for the _limited editon_ sakura (cherry blossom) flavour, which was a soft pink colour and had a subtle floral taste to it, it kind of just tasted like a slightly floral strawberry, it was really good! 🌸
- Osaka Wonder Loop cruise
  - We hopped on the Osaka Wonder Loop cruise, which is a boat tour that takes you along the Dotonbori canal, giving you a unique perspective of the district from the water.
  - The cruise lasts about 20 minutes and takes you under the famous Dotonbori **Dotonbori Ebisu Bridge** and past the iconic **Glico** sign, which is a famous landmark in Osaka.
  - The boat takes you right under the bridge, close enough that you could reach out and touch the bridge, if you staff hadn't warned us not to in advance... 👀
  - You'll also see a few other famous landmarks, such as the **Don Quijote Ferris wheel** and
  - The whole strip of Dotonbori comes alive at night with neon lights, reflecting off the water and creating a blanerunner-esque atmosphere — it's something you'll find difficult to find anywhere else in the world!
- Quick stop at the nearby giant **Don Quijote** store to grab some snacks and souvenirs for our flight home
- Carrying our snack haul, we headed back to the hotel to prepare for tomorrows trip to Nara

### Nara

- Did the usual iced coffee run to a nearby 7/11
- Boarded the special [Narashika-themed Kintetsu Line train](https://fromjapan.info/kintetsurailway-topics-about-explore-the-beauty-of-nara-and-its-surroundings-with-a-cute-narashika-train/) from Kintetsu-Nippombashi Station to Kintesu-Nara Station
- Walked from Kintetsu-Nara Station to [Higashimuki Shopping Street](https://www.visitnara.jp/venues/S01128/)
- Stopped by a cosy little izakaya style restaraunt called [Kamaiki](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298198-d3817383-Reviews-Kamaiki-Nara_Nara_Prefecture_Kinki.html) for lunch which
  is quite well known for their homemade noodles which are freshly cut and boiled every morning, typically served with a side of tempura
  - I went for the udon and side of shrimp tempura, whiel Yuki went for the chicken karaage, udon and crab tempura
- We then grabbed some special Nara soy doughnuts from [Floresta Narahonten](https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Restaurant_Review-g298198-d1697792-Reviews-Floresta_Narahonten-Nara_Nara_Prefecture_Kinki.html) and
  sat down to enjoy them with a hot coffee — they were so good, we ended up getting seconds! 🍩
- Headed over to the Nara Deer Park
- Bought some deer crackers (got harassed)
- Made our way along the walking path to Kasuga Taisha latern path
  - Along the way we saw many deer lurking around the lanterns, watching us as we continued walking—you could feel their eyes on you, it was obvious they were hoping for some food
    from us, as we weren't locals in their terriority!
  - Kasuga Taisha (春日大社) is a Shinto shrine in Nara, Japan, famous for its many bronze lanterns that line the paths leading to the shrine.
- Checked out the [Todai-ji Daibutsuden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji) (Great Buddha Hall)
- Came back to say goodbye to the deers and head back to Osaka
- Dinner at Kura Sushi (回転寿司) — a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain in Japan
  - We enjoyed playing the little game on our table where you can win a prize if you collect enough plates, but we got absolutely scammed! 😂
  - We ate a total of 15 plates, with 3 attempts and nothing in return, I being stubborn and trying to win something pushed us up to 20 plates for one last attempt
  - But even that wasn't enough, so we left empty handed, our consolation prize was leaving with full stomachs! 🫃
