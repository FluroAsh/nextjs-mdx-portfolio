{/* Part 1 */}

## Tokyo (5 days)

The start of our journey kicked off with a flight from Melbourne to Tokyo aboard Philippine Airlines, the flight itself is about 12 hours long,
but including the 8 hour layover in Manila we spent closer to 20 hours neither in Melbourne or Tokyo, hooray for the airport lounge
we managed to book! 🫠 I don't think I would have survived without the buffet and a comfortable chair to have a snooze in. 😴

After the very long layover and "short" 4-hour flight, we finally arrived at Haneda Airport and took a taxi to a hotel which we could recharge at, about 10 minutes away.
Although let me tell you, it took us a good 20 minutes to figure out which one of the many levels of the airport we actually needed to be at so we could
get a taxi (without being ripped off). 😅

Once we arrived at our overnight hotel, we checked in and caught up on some much-needed sleep — light outs!

The next day, we woke up early to catch a shuttle bus back to Haneda Airport to catch a train, despite expecting warm Spring weather,
we were instead greeted with a brief snowy morning and grey skies all around. 🌨️

### Akihabara

After being dropped off at Haneda Airport, we took some time to get our [Suica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suica) cards (a prepaid card for public transport) and then hopped on the
train to Akihabara, the famous district known for its electronics shops, anime, manga culture, and maid cafes... 😳🚆

![Akihabara Male Maid Cafe](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-05/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-05.webp)
_Akihabara Male Maid Cafe_

Getting to Akihabara was a breeze, the train system in Tokyo is very efficient and easy to navigate (with a bit of a helping hand from Google Maps).
We arrived at Akihabara station, and with our luggage in hand, we set off to venture around and find a storage shop to drop off our bags.

![Akihabara Station](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-14/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-14.webp)
_Akihabara Station_

We search for a good 30 minutes, walking around circles with our heads buried into Google maps before finally spotting a tiny opening in a shopping strip
just across from the local starbucks, it was random tech repair shops and other weird gizmos...
But there it was, a storage shop! We hand over our bags to the old Japanese man and hope they're still there when we get back... Arigato gozaimasu! 🙏😅

Of course, now being nearly 1:30PM, we _had_ to cross the street and check into Starbucks after only living off airplane coffee and airplane food for the 24 hours — _WE NEEDED COFFEE!_ 🤯☕️

![Akihabara Station Starbucks](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-15/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-15.webp)

Now refuled and our veins pumped with caffeine, we head off into search of a place to eat lunch.
After a bit of searching on Google Maps, and walking around, we find a small Gyukatsu restaraunt located down some stairs which lead us into
the basement level of a building, it was called [Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066443-d14028838-Reviews-Gyukatsu_Motomura_Akihabara-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) (牛カツ もと村).

![Gyukatsu Set](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/tokyo-2/large_tokyo-2.webp)
_Gyukatsu Motomura_
We order a Gyukatsu set, which is a breaded and deep-fried beef cutlet served with:

- A side of rice
- Red miso soup (slightly stronger than your typical miso soup)
- Shredded cabbage
- [Grated yam](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tororo_(food)>) (Tororo)
- [Warabimochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warabimochi) (sweet Mochi like dessert from the [Kansai region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region))
- Various sauces and conidements

One of the best things about Japan is that you get wasabi with (almost) everything, given I'm always getting like 3 extra packets of wasabi whenever
ordering sushing In Australia, I was a happy boy. 😍

The gyukatsu we had provided prepared raw, so you could cook it the way god intended (medium-rare) on a hot stone until
mouth wateringly juicy — what a great way to start our trip! 😏

{/* Wondering around Akihabara... */}
After our lunch we set out to adventure around [Akihabara electric town](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html), where we admired the unique architecture, neon lights and bustling atmopshere — this is the
central hub for anime, manga and gaming culture in Japan, we made sure to make the most of it and stop along the endless rows of manga, retro gaming & anime shops
along the way.

![Akihabara Streets with Taxi's](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-09/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-09.webp)

The weather was finally starting to clear up, and even the sun was coming out to say hello, so I did what any good tourist would do and I took some photos of unique streets and buildings
around me — I even managed to snap a photo of some little tiny Uber cars driving around.

I didn't know it at the time, but these little cars are actually fully licensed taxis in Japan.
They are called ["JPN Taxi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_JPN_Taxi) and are designed to be compact, accessible (for its aging population) as-well as efficient for navigating the narrow streets of Japan — fun fact, they were also designed after
[London's black cabs](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/29/the-new-japan-taxi-from-toyota-wants-to-be-an-international-icon/). 🚕🇬🇧

![Akihabara GiGO Building](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-11/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-11.webp)
_GiGO Akihabara 4_

While making our way towards Don Quiijote, we stumbled spot one of the many [GiGO](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GENDA_GiGO_Entertainment) around Akihabara, this one was GiGO Akihabara no. 4. It's a known popular arcade chain in Japan
filled with arcade games and claw machines — claw machines being the main speciality of this particular store, ever since it was sold off by [SEGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega) in 2020.

![Don Quijote](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-07/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-07.webp)
_Don Quijote Akihabara_

Finally we arrive at the main destination for the day, the famous [Don Quijote](https://www.donki.com/en/) store in Akihabara.
We're greeted by the iconic yellow and red sign, and the store's mascots, a penguin named "Donpen" (ドンペン) with his pink companion "Donko" (ドンキョン) 🐧 — they're both symbols of the store's quirky and playful atmosphere.

We have a bit of a browse around the store, and I manage to find a few things that look pretty interesting, _HEAPS_, of anime anod manga merchandise across the eight total floors in the store.
Ultimately though, we leave empty handed as we didn't want to get too crazy on the first day of our trip, and we still had so much more to see! (Spoiler alert — we load up on goodies in [Osaka](#osaka-3-days) anyway 🛍️😂)...

With that out of our system, we head on back to pick up our luggage from the storage shop, and make our way back towards Akihabara station to get one last coffee fix, and a quick snack before heading to our hotel in Asakusa.

Our coffee shop of choice this time was Sarutahiko Coffee, a popular coffee shop in Akihabara right beside Akihabara station.
![Sarutahiko Coffee](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/tokyo-8/large_tokyo-8.webp)

The _final_ stop! We couldn't resist grabbing one of Cow Cow Kitchen's famous “Milk Pies” — a creamy Hokkaido milk-filled pastry wrapped in golden, flaky crust. 😏 While it's a bit of a
cult favorite in Japan (especially among dessert lovers and tourists), it's still a hidden gem outside the country.

Safe to say... worth... every... bite. 🐮

### Senso-ji

We finally hop onto the train and make our way to Asakusa after a long day, on the way we see the [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree) in the distance — we never do make it there,
but it's still a landmark to admire and take in, plus I've got proof I was (nearly) there! 😅
![Tokyo Skytree street walk](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-19/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-19.webp)

We make our way towards our hotel in Asakusa, a quaint little place called [T-Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/t-qian-cao.en-gb.html) tucked away in a quiet seemingly residential area with plenty of non-descript little traditional Japanese restaraunts hidden away.
Many of these restaraunts often do not take reversations or accept foreigners, as we were soon to find out! But more on that later... 😉

![Asakusa Streets](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-21/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-21.webp)
_Asakusa Backstreets_

Coming face-to-face with our hotel, we see just how small things can really get in Tokyo. Even though it's 6 stories tall, the building looks like it's only about 5 meters wide.

The entire room was extremely narrow, with 2 rooms on each of the 6 floors, it was giving me the same vibes we had in Hong Kong with how compact everything was, albeit _slightly_ more spacious when taking into account the bathroom... 😅

      caption: "Our homebase for the next 3 days",
    },
  ]}
/>

Once we finish checking into our hotel, and taking a moment to rest our little feet, we throw our luggage into the corner and head out to [Senso-ji Temple](#Senso-ji) to have a look around the markets, and take some pictures before nightfall settles in.

Our hotel was conveniently about a 10 minute walk from Senso-ji Temple, making our first destination of the trip super easy to get to.

![Crossing Opposite Senso-ji Temple](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-22/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-22.webp)

Making our way across the road, we get our first glimpse of the main temple, it's referred to as Kannon-dō (観音堂) or Hondō (本堂) and it is the main hall of Senso-ji Temple, which is dedicated to the [bodhisattva Kannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin) (観音), the goddess of mercy and compassion.

![Senso-ji Main Temple](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-23/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-23.webp)
_Hondō (本堂)_

Often in travel videos and photos you just see the main shopping street with the gate pictured in the background, but what don't see it just how large the
entire temple compelx is, with the main hell being surrounded by a large courtyard and many other smaller shrines and buildings scattered around the area.

      alt: "Hondō (本堂) at Asakusa Shrine with Senso-ji Pagoda ",
    },
  ]}
/>

A short walk from the main hall, we also stumble to a very small shrine called [Asakusa Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa_Shrine) (浅草神社), which is a Shinto shrine located within the Senso-ji Temple complex.

![Hondō Front Entrance](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-29/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-29.webp)

Heading on over towards the inner temple grounds infront of the main hall, you can see the giant lantern hanging from the roof which sits directly infront of the
offering boxes, where you can throw in a coin(s) and make a wish. Generally you would also bow twice, clap your hands twice, and then bow once more to show respect to the gods.

- Hōzōmon (宝蔵門) means “Treasure House Gate” and is the **inner gate** of Sensō-ji Temple, located beyond Nakamise-dōri and before the main hall (Hondō).
- Originally built in the 10th century and reconstructed multiple times — the current structure dates to 1964, rebuilt using reinforced concrete after being destroyed in World War II.
- The gate has **two massive Niō guardian statues** (also known as Kongōrikishi) on either side of the central passage, symbolizing protection against evil.
- Above the passage hangs a large **red chōchin lantern** bearing the characters for “Kobunachō” (小舟町), donated by the town of the same name.
- On either side of the large central lantern are **two bronze lanterns** — and behind the gate hangs a large **waraji** (straw sandal), traditionally believed to ward off evil spirits.
- The second floor of the gate houses the **temple’s sacred texts and treasures**, which is how it earned its name, “Treasure House Gate.”
- Architecturally, it's more imposing and wide than Kaminarimon, with **thicker pillars** and a more fortified presence.
- It serves as the symbolic threshold between the commercial approach (Nakamise) and the sacred temple grounds.

_Nakamise (仲見世通り) Shopping Street_

As we stroll through the iconic **Hōzōmon Gate**, we stumble into the famous [Nakamise Shopping Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens%C5%8D-ji#Nakamise-d%C5%8Dri) (仲見世通り), a vibrant and bustling street lines with shops selling traditional snacks, souvenirs and crafts.

![10](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-36/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-36.webp)

With the sun setting and stores closing soon, we decided to soak in the atmosphere of one of Japan's oldest shopping streets, saving the shopping for later.
Dating back to the 12th century, this 250-meter path leading to Sensō-ji Temple was bustling with crowds — a classic part of the cherry blossom season experience in Japan. 😅

The street blends tradition and modernity, with Edo-style wooden shopfronts mixed alongside bright neon signs, making you feel like you've stepped back in time.
While it felt a bit touristy, we enjoyed the unique vibe. A few shops were crafting traditional Geta (下駄) sandals and selling Yukata (浴衣),
but most were geared towards snacks and souvenirs.

...

{/* Kaminarimon — the Thunder Gate */}
![11](https://s3-upload-thing.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/japan-2025/tokyo/day-1/nkon-tokyo-d1-38/large_nkon-tokyo-d1-38.webp)

- Kaminarimon, or "Thunder Gate," is the iconic outer gate of Sensō-ji Temple and one of Tokyo’s most photographed landmarks.
- Originally built in 941 AD and later relocated to its current spot in Asakusa in the early 17th century.
- The massive red lantern hanging in the center is 3.9 meters tall, weighs around 700 kg, and reads "雷門" (Kaminarimon) — meaning "Thunder Gate."
- Flanking the gate are statues of **Fūjin** (god of wind) and **Raijin** (god of thunder), symbolizing protection and good fortune.
- The lantern is made of washi paper over a bamboo frame and is replaced approximately every 10 years due to weathering.
- The gate marks the entrance to **Nakamise Shopping Street**, leading to Sensō-ji Temple.
- Kaminarimon is a common meeting point for tours and a starting place for exploring Asakusa.
- At night, the gate is beautifully illuminated, making it a great spot for photos without the daytime crowds.
- The lantern is temporarily lifted during festivals and parades to allow tall floats to pass underneath.
- While it’s always busy, early morning or late evening visits offer a more peaceful experience and better photo opportunities.

- Kaminarimon-dori Street (雷門通り) is the main street leading from Kaminarimon Gate to Sensō-ji Temple
- From this street you can spot the iconic Asahi Breweries headquarters building, which features a large golden flame sculpture on its roof, often humorously referred to as the "Golden Poo" (金色のうんこ) by locals

{/* --- End of the night... ---- */}

Our first night of looking for a restaraunt in Asakusa was a bit of a challenge though, we got the "Gaijin" (foreigner) treatment at a few places, where they either didn't want to serve us or were fully booked out.
So we fallback to Plan B as the sun had well and truly headed to sleep by this point... 👇

_The late-night Lawson's haul!_

Ya'll already know I'm about that konbini life! In the end, we headed over to the nearest [Lawson](https://www.lawson.co.jp/) for some staples... Fried chicken and onigiri (rice balls), with a special super creamy pudding
for desert. With a full stomach, before I knew it I was already nodding off for the night — we were exhausted from the long day of exploring. 💤

### Team Lab Borderless

Day 2

- Orange Street snack & brunch
- Local Charm, Just Off the Main Path — Orange Street runs parallel to Nakamise-dori but feels like a secret—quieter, less tourist-heavy, and favored by locals.
- Name Origins — The "Orange" in the name doesn’t refer to fruit—it was likely chosen in the post-war Showa era to give the street a stylish, westernized appeal.
- Classic Tokyo Atmosphere — Expect retro signage, narrow shopfronts, and Showa-era buildings. It’s one of the last places in Tokyo where you can really feel the city’s past intact.
- A Hidden Foodie Strip — Home to understated culinary gems like kissaten (retro cafés), taiyaki stalls, bakeries, and traditional eateries frequented by locals.
- Cultural Contrast — Just steps from the busy Senso-ji temple crowds, yet feels worlds apart—perfect for slowing down, people-watching, and soaking in authentic Tokyo.
- Vintage + Functional Retail — You’ll find everything from barber shops and hardware stores to capsule toy machines and traditional crafts—still serving daily needs, not just tourists.
- Photogenic but Subtle — While not flashy, it’s full of texture: faded wood signs, overhead wires, handwritten menus, and locals going about their routines.

  - Taiyaki (たい焼き) is a fish-shaped cake that is typically filled with sweet red bean paste, custard, chocolate, or other fillings.
  - The name "taiyaki" literally means "baked sea bream" in Japanese, as the shape of the cake resembles a sea bream fish.
  - Taiyaki is often enjoyed as a street food snack and can be found at various food stalls and shops throughout Japan.
