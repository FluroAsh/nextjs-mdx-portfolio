{/* Part 1 */}

## Tokyo

The start of our journey kicked off with a flight from Melbourne to Tokyo aboard Philippine Airlines, the flight itself is about 12 hours long,
but including the 8 hour layover in Manila we spent closer to 20 hours neither in Melbourne or Tokyo, hooray for the airport lounge
we managed to book! 🫠 I don't think I would have survived without the buffet and a comfortable chair to have a snooze in. 😴

After the very long layover and "short" 4-hour flight, we finally arrived at Haneda Airport and took a taxi to our hotel about 10 minutes away,
though let me tell you, it took us a good 20 minutes to figure out which one of the many levels of the airport we actually needed to get be to
get a taxi (without being ripped off). 😅

Once we arrived at our hotel, we checked in and caught up on some much-needed sleep — light outs!

The next day, we woke up early to catch a shuttle bus to our next hotel in Asakusa, despite expecting warm Spring weather,
we were instead greeted with a brief snowy morning and grey skies all around. 🌨️

### Akihabara

After being dropped off at Haneda Airport, we took some time to get our Suica cards (a prepaid card for public transport) and then hopped on the
train to Akihabara, the famous district known for its electronics shops, anime, manga culture, and maid cafes... 😳🚆

Getting to Akihabara was a breeze, the train system in Tokyo is very efficient and easy to navigate (with a bit of a helping hand from Google Maps).
We arrived at Akihabara station, and with our luggage in hand, we set off to venture around and find a storage shop to drop off our bags.

We search for a good 30 minutes, walking around circles with our heads buried into Google maps before finally spotting a tiny opening in a shopping strip filled
with random tech repair shops and other weird gizmos. Finally, a storage shop! 🥳 We hand over our bags to the old Japanese man and hope they're still there when we get back.🏃‍➡️

Of course, we had to make a stop at Starbucks after only living off airplane coffee and airplane food for the 24 hours — _WE NEEDED COFFEE!_ 🤯☕️

We also take the chance to try some Cow Cow Kitchen's "Milk Pie" (a delicious milk pie with a flaky crust). 😏
