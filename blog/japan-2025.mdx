{/* Part 1 */}

## Tokyo (5 days)

The start of our journey kicked off with a flight from Melbourne to Tokyo aboard Philippine Airlines, the flight itself is about 12 hours long,
but including the 8 hour layover in Manila we spent closer to 20 hours neither in Melbourne or Tokyo, hooray for the airport lounge
we managed to book! ü´† I don't think I would have survived without the buffet and a comfortable chair to have a snooze in. üò¥

After the very long layover and "short" 4-hour flight, we finally arrived at Haneda Airport and took a taxi to our hotel about 10 minutes away,
though let me tell you, it took us a good 20 minutes to figure out which one of the many levels of the airport we actually needed to get be to
get a taxi (without being ripped off). üòÖ

Once we arrived at our hotel, we checked in and caught up on some much-needed sleep ‚Äî light outs!

The next day, we woke up early to catch a shuttle bus to our next hotel in Asakusa, despite expecting warm Spring weather,
we were instead greeted with a brief snowy morning and grey skies all around. üå®Ô∏è

### Akihabara

After being dropped off at Haneda Airport, we took some time to get our Suica cards (a prepaid card for public transport) and then hopped on the
train to Akihabara, the famous district known for its electronics shops, anime, manga culture, and maid cafes... üò≥üöÜ

Getting to Akihabara was a breeze, the train system in Tokyo is very efficient and easy to navigate (with a bit of a helping hand from Google Maps).
We arrived at Akihabara station, and with our luggage in hand, we set off to venture around and find a storage shop to drop off our bags.

We search for a good 30 minutes, walking around circles with our heads buried into Google maps before finally spotting a tiny opening in a shopping strip
just across from the local starbucks, it was random tech repair shops and other weird gizmos...
But there it was, a storage shop! We hand over our bags to the old Japanese man and hope they're still there when we get back... Arigato gozaimasu! üôèüòÖ

Of course, we had to cross the street and check into Starbucks after only living off airplane coffee and airplane food for the 24 hours ‚Äî _WE NEEDED COFFEE!_ ü§Ø‚òïÔ∏è

Now refuled and our veins pumped with caffeine, we head off into search of a place to eat lunch.
After a bit of searching on Google Maps, and walking around, we find a small Gyukatsu restaraunt located down some stairs which lead us into
the basement level of a building, it was called [Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d7898108-Reviews-Gyukatsu_Motomura_Shibuya-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) (Áâõ„Ç´„ÉÑ „ÇÇ„Å®Êùë).

We order a Gyukatsu set, which is a breaded and deep-fried beef cutlet served with:

- A side of rice
- Red miso soup (slightly stronger than your typical miso soup)
- Sliced cabbage
- [Grated yam](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tororo_(food)>) (Tororo)
- [Warabimochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warabimochi) (sweet Mochi like dessert from the Kansai region)
- Various sauces and conidements

One of the best things about Japan is that you get wasabi with just about everything, and I was loving it! üòç

The Gyukatsu we had provided was uncooked, so you could cook it the way god intended (medium-rare) on a hot stone until
mouth wateringly juicy ‚Äî what a great way to start our trip! üòè

Our second last stop in Akihabara before heading to our hotel in Asakusa was Sarutahiko Coffee, a popular coffee shop in Akihabara.
