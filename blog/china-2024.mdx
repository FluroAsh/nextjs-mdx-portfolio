## Setting the Stage...

> [!WARNING]
> This is the longest recount of a trip you might read that hasn't been turned into a full-length novel. I'd advise skimming

Come along with me as I recount my debut journey through China, guided by my partner who dished out all the insider tips for exploring a selection of the <em>MANY</em> cities that should undoubtedly find a spot on your bucket list.

Picture this: the breathtaking panorama from The Bund of the Shanghai Tower by the Hangpu River with the accompanying city skyline; the enchanting West Lake, a natural wonder that left us in awe (with a Starbucks never too far away, for that extra touch of comfort). The contrast of tradition and innovation is woven into the very fabric of these cities, with each turn offering a fresh page of history and every hidden lane-way a portal to the past.
Ready to dive into the details of our expedition, where every twist and turn reveals a chapter in the captivating story of China? Let's embark on this story together! üåè

## Shanghai (2 Days)

[Century Park](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Park_(Shanghai)>), the biggest park in Shanghai measuring in at 350 acres and built in just four years between 1996-2000.
Shrouded in an enclave of tall residential buildings, you almost feel like you're in the Shanghai equivalent of Central Park. üòÜ

![Ash standing by the river in the People's Garden](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/pg_ash_portrait_b6eaf6bf22.webp)

Here you'll see me standing beside the winding Zhangjia River which connects to the famous 113km [Huangpu River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_River)
and runs through most of Shanghai.

![DSC_1963.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_1963_f6f8bf29c4.webp)

Century Park offers more than just a river Ôºç it features sizable forest areas,
lawns and a serene lake to get away from the busy streets.

### Wukang Mansion

[Wukang Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wukang_Mansion) also known as <em>Normandie Apartments</em>, is a 20th century cultural blend of Chinese and Western architectural styles located in the famous [French Concession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_French_Concession) area of Shanghai.
Originally built in 1924, the historic structure displays intricate detailing and a distinctive triangular shape you might expect to see in New York when stumbling across the [Flatiron Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_Building)

![Wukang Mansion](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_1979_87860a69e8.webp)

### Site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party

This is the [Site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_the_First_National_Congress_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party), where in 1921, renowned figures like Mao Zedong gathered in this meticulously
preserved Shikumen-style building.

![Site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2007_10e10829a9.webp)

Here, they laid the groundwork for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), shaping
its revolutionary policies that would significantly impact the course of Chinese
history.

![Venchi Ice Cream](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/venchi_icecream_1460cdc7c1.webp)

After taking in all that history though, we took an intermission and grabbed
ourselves some ice-cream from [Venchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venchi) ! A
famous Italian chocolatier selling everything your sweet tooth can handle. I'm a
sucker for waffle cones, let alone when it's paired with a honeycomb crumb and
chocolate coated top... I was weak in the knees, and couldn't say no. üçù

### Chenghuang Miao (Shanghai's City God Temple) &amp; Yu Garden

The majestic and profound [Shanghai's City God Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_God_Temple_of_Shanghai) as a first time visitor blew me away with the traditional and distinctive
Chinese architecture, resonating with Shanghai's rich history and spiritual heritage.

![Shanghai Skyline](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2055_f270e92dfd.webp)

This temple is dedicated to the three gods [HuoGuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huo_Guang), Qin Yubo and [Chen Huacheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Huacheng)
of which were all high ranking officials and immortalized in this tribute to their sacrifice and service.

![Temple Street View](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2061_d4595ba525.webp)

Our first view of the temple from the outside, on the left is a long pedestrian
street filled with stalls you can fill up with traditional Chinese BBQ'd snacks,
bubble tea and various other small treats to keep you exploring the winding
passages inside the temple grounds. We came here just as they were starting to
prepare for the Chinese New Year, that's why you can observe many dragons
lurking around and fish adorned on the embellishments of each temple floor from
the exterior.

![Temple Courtyard](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2087_Enhanced_NR_2361e7b199.webp)

The square of Chenghuang Miao. You'll find lots of little shops as-well as small
and discrete tea-shops, restaurants and small areas for praying to various
deities where people will bring offerings in the hope of good fortune, luck in
their relationships or peace.

![Temple Shrine](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2099_1f8ce974da.webp)

Moving into the inner area we find the main temple which has been a Taoist
center since it was handed over to the Shanghai Taoist Association in 1951.
You'll encounter lots of people coming here to pray with incense in hand. We
followed suite, so here's hoping good fortunate comes my way! üôè

![Temple Shrine Priests](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2106_d077159dfc.webp)

While walking around we were fortunate enough to encounter some of the resident Taoist priests conducting their worship.

![Pagoda Amongst Rocks & Trees](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2196_a2bac9c71d.webp)

[Yu Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Garden), a masterpiece originally crafted in the Ming Dynasty it invokes a sense of peace and serenity as
you pass through the ornate pavilions, lush courtyards and become captivated by the beautiful water features Ôºç from serene ponds to gracefully flowing streams.

![Pond Nestled Amongst Trees in an Oriential Garden](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2223_Enhanced_NR_227b0b70bb.webp)

Coming from Melbourne gardens to the meticulously crafted Yu Garden, bleeding with history, one could really spend their entire day here.
Yet, with so much more to see, it's time to move to the next destination!

![Oriential Style Building](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2278_Enhanced_NR_e16dcbf5d4.webp)

We arrive back into the main center of the temple grounds, surrounded by restaurants, the ornately deigned buildings and a slightly different scene
with the night-time ambience... It's leaving us a bit... hungry... So we headed over to [Nanxiang](https://guide.michelin.com/en/shanghai-municipality/shanghai/restaurant/nanxiang-steamed-bun-city-god-temple)
to get our dumpling fix!

![Nanxiang Steamed Bun Sign](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/nanxiang_steamed_bun_94492b72d7.webp)

Nanxiang was awarded [the Bib Gourmand](https://guide.michelin.com/en/article/features/the-bib-gourmand) award
by Michelin, and fully endorsed by my partner Ôºç I could hardly say no, and
neither could my stomach.

![Giant Soup Dumpling](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/giant_soup_dumpling_nanxiang_7067d641dc.webp)

We enjoyed a comically over-sized crab soup dumpling, which was delicious! Just... Not so easy to eat for a traveler such as myself... ü´£

![Dragon Lanterns](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2290_Enhanced_NR_38ab1ac0ca.webp)

After our hearty meal we ventured outside, where before we could see the lights
radiating into the third floor of the restaurant, we were now greeted by a crowd
of people and a masterfully crafted and delicate lanterns display. At this point
I was really getting in the Chinese New Year spirit ü•≥

![Streetside View of the City God Temple](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2310_Enhanced_NR_982c6c9a53.webp)

But it couldn't last forever, we were tired after a long day and a big feast!
One final parting photo of the City God Temple.

### Nanjing Road

[Nanjing Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Road), the lively heart of Shanghai serves as the bustling playground for urban exploration,
shopping or just a bit of harmless sight seeing Ôºç just stay on your toes in-case someone invites you back to their tea shop, or tries to sell you
some <em>"genuine"</em> designer labels üòâ

![Nanjing Road](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2336_9dead48c9e.webp)

Surrounded by vibrant neon lights, and a near endless array of shops you're taken aback by the blend of tradition and innovation that Shanghai offers.
There's a reason it's known as the one of the world's busiest shopping streets. Look out Chapel street!

![DSC_2346.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2346_7cfeb1681e.webp)

We of course stopped at a corner-side Dim Sum shop called [Shen Dacheng](http://en.sdc1875.com/about.shtml) that also serves mochi-style snacks,
my motto is: "If it's busy with the locals, then it's good enough for me!" ü§£ It's amazing that this shop has been
running since 1875, over nearly <strong>150 years!</strong> We snatched a few of the long white mochi snacks in the back and carried on our way down Nanjing Road.

![DSC_2312-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2312_Enhanced_NR_0955a663e3.webp)

Entering into the main shopping district of Nanjing Road we're met by a full moon hovering over the rooftops. When walking between the huge buildings,
you feel like the rest of the world becomes so small üåù

### The Bund &amp; Oriental Pearl Tower

[The Bund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund) is a charming place enriched by the Arc Deco and neoclassical buildings
lining waterfront promenade that echo back to Shanghai's colonial past.

![DSC_2356-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2356_Enhanced_NR_d64c060677.webp)

One such building is the [Custom House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_House,_Shanghai0) sitting a stones
throw away from the waterfront. Built in 1927, it is seen as one of the symbols
of The Bund and Shanghai and still operates as a customs house today.

![DSC_2361-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2361_Enhanced_NR_34e9ea1944.webp)

Across the Huangpu river you are met by the picturesque Pudong skyline, with iconic skyscrapers like the [Oriental Pearl Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Pearl_Tower)
or the [Shanghai Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Tower) that make it feel like you've been pulled into someones desktop wallpaper.

### Disneyland (Shanghai)

With our adventure through most of Shanghai now coming to a close, we needed to
visit somewhere a little <em>magical</em>... So today we set our sights on [Disneyland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Disneyland).

![DSC_2537.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2537_f85877a77f.webp)

My first time at Disneyland and I'm greeted by none other than [Donald Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck)!
Though, with an ominous foggy backdrop getting a good view of the castle might have turned out to be a challenge.

![DSC_2546.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2546_bceb3d03fe.webp)

Making it through the front gate <em>relatively</em> unscathed (scanning in with
my Passport, and a regrettably weird looking mug shot saved to their system), we
get our first glimpse of the entrance into the main part of the park. Not a lot
of blue skies, but at-least I can still spot Mickey on the clock!

![DSC_2565.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2565_e549bec45e.webp)

The Christmas decorations were still in full swing, and the Christmas tree was
emanating the festive spirit. The morning we first got to see the castle wasn't
the best in terms of visibility, but we could still feel a bit of that Disney
magic nonetheless.

![DSC_2585.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2585_4af9b0ae4a.webp)

By the time we had made our way over into the [Pirates of the Caribbean](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)>) themed area of the park,
it actually cleared up quite a bit! Just a shame we're, so... so... far away. We got a little lagoon and a cool ship in the shot though! I even got to walk on it, and...

![DSC_2601.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2601_0cbba9b830.webp)

Well... I lost a leg. At-least that's what my partner will tell you. ü§£ It's
alright, it grew back! No boyfriends were hurt in the making of this Blog post
ü§´

![DSC_2637.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2637_bc072777ba.webp)

If you were a 90's kid, you probably remember these guys! Say hello to
[Woody](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_(Toy_Story)>) and [BuzzLightyear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear). Naturally, they're being towed around by Hamm and Slinky Dog, with Rex on the
reigns. If only my toys were as lively as these guys! There were a few others like Mulan in this little parade, but I stan Buzz üòá

![DSC_2685-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2685_Enhanced_NR_0c2bff3871.webp)

The first adrenaline pumping ride we went on was this [TRON Coaster ride](https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/attractions/tron-lightcycle-power-run/).
I remember watching the movie when it first came out, featuring the [Daft Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk) sound track, so even waiting in-line was a blast for me üé∂

![DSC_2697-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2697_Enhanced_NR_44ecd4e6c5.webp)

An image worth 180 minutes. That's right, we waited in-line to enter the newly opened [Zootopia](https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/disney-zootopia/)
area of the park for <strong>three hours</strong>. If you thought I was stubborn before, let it be known that I will not leave a line I have voluntarily entered
if I've waited longer than 20 minutes ü§≠ But in all seriousness, it was cool! I had seen the movie, but I wasn't entranced by the story, it was the
design of the area that left me in awe. Seeing animals running around a literal concrete jungle was more than a little entertaining, even for this 28 year old
bloke from Australia.

![zootopia-feels.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/zootopia_feels_b3bde5c3a8.webp)

The man behind the camera making a surprise appearance... And the partner
peacing out as we head over to the next spot on the map ‚úåÔ∏è

![DSC_2875-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2875_Enhanced_NR_a231d83719.webp)

After heading out from the Zootopia area we got a bit of a closer look at the
Disneyland castle up close, at night. Lit up by the lights, it makes you realise
just how magical it can be. Of course, there's a restaurant so you can eat
inside the castle (if you're willing to dish out for the Disneyland fine dining
experience). You can also just go up the inner stairs and say <em>howdy</em> to
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in a little mini-attraction that walks through
the story from start to finish, well the abridged version anyway üòâ

![DSC_2762.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2762_87fe1cfbbc.webp)

On our way back to the main area for some dinner we ran into another parade,
this time with the "Winter Magic" theme. And it was definitely Winter because
you could see your breath leaving your body ü•∂

![DSC_2943.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2943_0ddd98a093.webp)
Finishing up our adventure in Disneyland, we caught the 9PM firework display.

You couldn't see too much, but it was still a ball to watch! Wait... Are we sure
this isn't Hogwarts? ü§îüßô&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Hangzhou (1 Day)

### The West Lake &amp; Leifeng Pagoda

Hangzhou for me was all about the perfect blend of history and flavor! You
become soaked in the beauty of the West Lake, surrounded by green hills and
ancient pagodas. Everywhere you turn, you are faced with a gorgeous garden or
stunning architecture.

![DSC_2375.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2375_95ce9d371d.webp)

Entering into the site of the West Lake I wasn't sure what to expect... ü§î But
the shrubs and trees towering overhead set the stage for what was to come.

![DSC_2378.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2378_38285f1482.webp)

We were met by [Qian Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qian_Liu), who in his
time from 852 AD was the founding king of [Wuyue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuyue) during the [Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period)
period of China Ôºç originally a warlord of the late [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty).

![DSC_2391.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2391_902016994e.webp)

Exploring the surroundings, we seize a perfect moment to capture one of the many
enchanting bridges that grace the West Lake, accompanied by the presence of a
majestic bronze buffalo. This derives from the age-old legend that has bestowed
upon the West Lake the moniker of the Golden Buffalo Lake. According to the
tale, a mythical golden buffalo lay dormant at the lake's depths. Each time the
lake dwindled, the buffalo would emerge, spouting water until it had filled once
more. In a bid to gain favor with the emperor, local officials urged their
community to drain the lake using waterwheels. As the lake's waters receded, the
buffalo materialized. However, the officials, eager to capture it, were met with
a startling twist. The buffalo, lifting its head in fury, emitted a torrent of
water, instantly submerging them. Since that moment, the West Lake has remained
abundant, and the elusive buffalo has remained hidden, except for its rare
appearance in my photograph, of course. üòâ

![DSC_2421.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2421_a78957e4c5.webp)

After enjoying a little bit of mysticism we head over to a small enchanting
island hidden away, only accessible by a short ferry, with a quaint little pond
placed in the center.

![DSC_2442.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2442_65e3254887.webp)

From this island you can see the famous [Leifeng Pagoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leifeng_Pagoda) and three small stone towers featured on the back of a ¬•1 bill Ôºç the fog
was still lurking around as you can see, but still an amazing sight.

![one_yuan_back.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/one_yuan_back_9d7f5f4260.webp)

The stones are colloquially known as the three pools mirroring the moon (‰∏âÊΩ≠Âç∞Êúà, sƒÅnt√°ny√¨nyu√®), each have space for candles and laterns to be lit
within them on autumn nights so that they can reflect out onto the waters surface Ôºç representing the <em>"three moons"</em>.

![DSC_2482.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2482_892c466373.webp)

Hello! üëãü§£ My partner waving to me as I stand there for a second wondering why
there's an escalator outside. That was definitely a first for me... ü§î But
onwards! Our first close-up look at Leifeng Pagoda.

![DSC_2493-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2493_Enhanced_NR_8c8afa1b5c.webp)

Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou isn't just a tower; it has a rich history dating back to its construction in 977 AD. Legend tells of its purpose to imprison Madame
[White Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Suzhen), a spirit in love with the human [Xu Xian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xian). Despite collapsing
in 1924 in the face of numerous reconstructions and repairs, the pagoda had again risen again on top of the old ruins, with the assistance of modern technology
in October of 1999. This gave new meaning to the enduring spirit of the love story, as it now stands, once again, by the West Lake. Adding a mystical layer,
locals once believed in the special powers of the pagoda's bricks. People stole them, grinding the bricks into powder, hoping for protection from illness and miscarriages,
which had ultimately lead to the collapse of the ancient pagoda.

![DSC_2509.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_2509_047b3e4c51.webp)

In the distance you can spot another temple sitting high on-top of a hill
surrounded by the juxtaposition of city, nature and small residential areas.

![grandmas-home-lotus-root.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/grandmas_home_lotus_root_826c9ff445.webp)

Our final West Lake escapade brought us to [Grandma's Home](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g298559-d3402387-Reviews-Grandma_s_Home_HangZhou_Mansion-Hangzhou_Zhejiang.html), where we wrapped up the day with a delightful dinner! One standout dish was
the intriguing lotus root creation ‚Äì a bit sweet, incredibly tender, and adorned
with dainty flower petals. I almost felt terrible eating it, but every bite was
absolutely worth it. ü§£

## Guangzhou (3 Days)

As we touched down in my partner's home city of Guangzhou after a short train
ride, we were off to meet some of her friends and get my fix of Yum Cha for
lunch to fill my belly.

![DSC_3014.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3014_adfd4224f8.webp)

We met them at [Panyu Hotel](http://www.panyuhotel.com/en-us/about_hotel.html), which in the classical Cantonese style is embellished with many overhanging
trees, water features and Koi fish, adding to the relaxing ambience around the restaurant.

![pork-buns.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/pork_buns_d68eb3d24c.webp)

If you haven't eaten Chinese food with me before, you know that when I order,
Pork Buns are <em>always</em> near the top of my list Ôºç and today was no
exception. üòé We ate at the [Li Yuan Hall](http://www.panyuhotel.com/en-us/restaurant_2.html) which was on the first floor, but there are nineteen halls total. ü§Ø I even
tried some sweet chili chicken feet, they were pretty good, but I'm not sure
this westerner can put up with the effort required to get to the eating part...
üëÄ

![chestnut-cake.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/chestnut_cake_bb45ff3720.webp)

One last present before saying wrapping up lunchÔºçone of my partners friends
made us a chestnut cake! It tasted as good as it looked. üòè We often don't get
to have chestnuts in Australia, the texture was fluffy and the taste not too
sweet. I may have turned into a chestnut believer. üôèüòé

### Canton Tower

[Canton Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_Tower) set against the blue sky, an architectural masterpiece gracing Guangzhou's skyline.
We hadn't seen blue in the sky for what felt like an eternity!

![DSC_3539.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3539_98983b56b2.webp)

Appreciating its height is a challenge until you ascend to the very top.
Construction concluded in 2010, marking the completion of its towering
structure, encompassing a total of 112 floors!

![DSC_3646-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3646_Enhanced_NR_87f2ac7b8d.webp)

In the evening, the Pearl River lights up with the vibrant glows of neon lights
from passing ferries, and lights from the illuminating digital billboards lining
the riverbank.

![DSC_3814-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3814_Enhanced_NR_24bc99e233.webp)

On our way down from Canton tower, we decide to go for a walk along the Pearl
River and get a better view of the [Liede Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liede_Bridge), a 4.3km suspension bridge connecting
[Pazhou Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazhou) in [Haizhu District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haizhu,_Guangzhou) with
[Tianhe District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe,_Guangzhou), originally opened in 2009.

![DSC_3949-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3949_Enhanced_NR_35a9fad3d5.webp)

On our way back to our hotel we get one last final look at Canton Tower, and I
get the perfect shot in-front of the <strong>"I ‚ù§Ô∏è GZ"</strong> sign. üòé

![DSC_3921-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3921_Enhanced_NR_9d777fb2be.webp)

One last photo for the road! Or rather... bridge? They sure do love gold over
there ü§î Time to head home. üöÜ

### Baomo Yuan (Cantonese Garden)

Today being a public holiday in China, we set out to [Baomo Yuan](https://www.chinatoursnet.com/guangzhou-travel-guide/attraction/baomo-garden.html)
with family for the day, to explore one of the bigger Cantonese style gardens we've visited on our trip.

![DSC_3064.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3064_6ac2ceeabe.webp)

At the entrance stands a towering wall crafted from 30,000 dark bricks, serving
as a captivating "screen wall" that adds an air of mystery, preventing visitors
from peering into the garden grounds, before turning the corner. Adorning the
facade are over 600 meticulously carved elements, including birds, insects,
flowers, and iconic symbols like phoenixes, pheasants, dragonflies, as well as
representations of pine, bamboo, willow, and peony.

![DSC_3084.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3084_a7f55b1f28.webp)

Our first sight of the garden is a pond filled with Koi fish, accompanied by a
vacant boat decorated with flowers and flowing fabric. Similar to many of the
other areas in the garden, you can feed the fish Ôºç for a price! Additionally,
you can also ride one of the boats here on a tour, but we didn't set aside time
to have a leisurely cruise around the garden.

![DSC_3101.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3101_c0c0dc7516.webp)

Shift your gaze to the right, and you'll discover a quaint pavilion nestled in
the distance, surrounded by lush greenery featuring stalactites. Interestingly,
these formations were relocated from a nearby cave system, lending a unique
contrast to the garden. Whether natural or transplanted, they contribute a
fascinating element to the overall charm of the scenery.

![DSC_3075.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3075_b8465fc30a.webp)

As we make our way around, we find an allegedly 1000 year old [Banyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan) tree. They're known to be a symbol of life,
longevity and immortality. Fans of [Avatar: the Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender), might recognise it as the iconic
[Banyan-grove Tree](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Banyan-grove_tree).

![DSC_3326.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3326_21a65c7d9d.webp)

Encountering more stalactites, this time on the opposite side from our initial
sighting, we get an up-close view of the pavilion from a different perspective.
Wander through the secluded area where a smaller pavilion is tucked away, and
you'll find yourself slightly elevated. Here, near a gentle waterfall, you can
overlook the garden from a unique angle, casting a different light on your
surroundings.

![DSC_3312.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3312_8139ec8c63.webp)

Here we found ourselves overlooking one of the Buddhist statues scattered around
the garden, inviting passersby to pause and reflect, surrounded by an expansive
pond that mirrors its calm and serene form. It's poetic that such a form would
be reflected onto a similarly calm and serene pond.

![DSC_3181.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3181_6bc90bbd1b.webp)

Strolling further, we found ourselves nestled in a rose garden, adorned with a
diverse array of rose varieties. The backdrop of Banyan trees gave me a great
chance to practice some more photography. It was definitely a popular spot, with
lots of visitors walking around, looking for the perfect spot to take a selfie!

![DSC_3314.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3314_99120b990a.webp)

[Baomo Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baomo_Yuan) is well known for offering visitors a chance to catch their own fish. Specially designated
pools offer a unique fishing experience ‚Äî armed with a net, your reflexes will be put to the test as you try to catch yourself a slippery prize to bring home.
We didn't give this a shot, as I don't think they would be up the for journey home. üòÇ Adding a bit of novelty, there was also what at first glance looked like
arcade machines. For a small price, you can gamify the art of fishing, perhaps walking with more fish than you would otherwise be able to catch with a
more traditional small net. üòâ

![DSC_3280.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3280_3ef3463f4e.webp)

The garden even has a small dedicated area just for turtles. In some places
around the garden you can buy baby turtles, and from what I've heard some people
will bring them here to be released in the hopes that it will bring good luck.
Maybe that's why there's <em>so</em> many of them! ü§î

![DSC_3295.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3295_2da11f19a4.webp)

It was around the late afternoon at this point, we stopped by one of the small
shops and grabbed ourselves some ice-cream. I went for the stock-standard
vanilla and chocolate, while my partner opted for mango peach. Although, if I'm
being completed honest, I just liked the look of the Koi fish... üòÇ

![DSC_3310.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3310_4d0145ae0f.webp)

The <strong>Zidai Bridge</strong> (on the left) is a nine-arch white stone bridge. It spans the <strong>Qingping lake</strong>, with thirty stone sculptures from historical novels placed on-top the railings. On the right is the <strong>Zilai Memorial Arch</strong> located in the center of the garden, built with white stone and embedded with twelve animals representing the Chinese
lunar years as-well as images of the [Eight Immortals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals) in Taoism, all in granite. The arch symbolizes the nobility of
incorruptible officials.

![DSC_3262.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3262_45d2a5bee2.webp)

Another small pond surrounding a tea shop where you can relax for a while and
collect your energy. In the foreground you can see a crane, as-well as a turtle
with a snake on its back. The significance of this display is a symbolization of
mutual support and cooperation, signifying a harmonious relationship between
opposing forces. There's a link to longevity, wisdom and protection, conveying
the belief of a balanced coexistence and contributing to a prosperous and
enduring life.

![DSC_3165.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3165_659dde5aba.webp)

Captured in this image is a breathtaking view of [Along the River During the Qingmin Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along_the_River_During_the_Qingming_Festival), portraying a scene from <strong>Bianliang</strong>, the capital of Northern
Song (modern-day [Kaifeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaifeng) in Henan Province). The focal point is a massive mural, stretching an
impressive <em>63 meters</em> in length and 7 meters in width‚Äî100 times the size
of the original painting created by [Zhang Zeduan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zeduan) in the [Song Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty) (960-1127 AD). The mural intricately details the bustling city life with <em>1648</em> figures, offering a vivid reflection of the prosperous trade in China
during that era. This visual narrative not only showcases historical
significance but also provides a glimpse into life during the
[Qingming Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival)
in <strong>Bianliang</strong>.

### Shamian Island

On our next day in Guangzhou, we head over to [Shamian Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamian), a charming enclave separated by a bridge from the rest of the province. It's a
historical island, steeped in colonial influence and European-style
architecture. It was once divided between the [British and French concessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_concessions_in_China)

<em>(80% British &amp; 20% french)</em>, until it was returned to Chinese
administration in 1943, creating a unique blend of Western and Chinese elements.

![DSC_3426.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3426_a739a47b5f.webp)

We make our way around the outskirts of the island, strolling along the narrow
streets and a canopy of overhanging trees lining the borders of the island.
There's a curious mix of residential and now small business buildings along the
roads, with some remnants of its historical past marked by either the historic
architecture, or signage that sits out the front of otherwise unassuming
facades.

![DSC_3431.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3431_4f7ee3bf44.webp)
One of the local cats having a nap. üì∏
![DSC_3353.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3353_cb6d54f2cb.webp)

There's a few churches located on Shamian Island, the one pictured being [Shamian Christian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamian_Christian_Church)
which had been built by [the Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England)

in 1865 for British expatriates, located in the British Concession. Naturally, the French Concession area of the island also had its own,
[Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Lourdes_Chapel,_Shamian_Island), which has been restored and was competed in 1892.

![DSC_3335.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3335_f87e99719f.webp)

As you explore the island, you'll stumble upon markers narrating its colonial
history, each accompanied by bronze statues capturing snapshots of days gone by.
How fortunate we are to have email. üôè

![DSC_3405.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3405_f7649baec6.webp)

The <strong>Bank of Taiwan</strong> building, although no longer functioning as
an active bank, serves as reminder of the complex history and international
influences that shaped the island during its service as a strategic port for
foreign trade. Today, many of these buildings now serve as government office
buildings, or residential apartments.

![DSC_3346.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3346_f9a415aaf2.webp)

Another similarly large building, close to the waterfront, likely serving as
housing for residents living on Shamian island. Historically, prior to 1943,
this would have served as a factory building. Note on the left side of the
building, you can observe a gate that would have been used for transporting
goods to the nearby ports located on the bank Pearl River bank.

![DSC_3419.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3419_0d41747926.webp)

Located in the French concession we found this large mansion, it appeared to be
some sort of Hostel or club, but was being restored when we were there, so
there's still some mystery around this one.

![DSC_3338.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3338_c4ac715243.webp)

At the heart of the island we found one of the main attractions, <strong> "Friendship Garden</strong>. It's a place you can unwind,
relax and enjoy some of surrounding greenery, with fountains and bronze statues meticulously placed along your path.

![DSC_3391.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3391_28c7c49d78.webp)

Between visitors taking photos, taking in all the lush greenery and flowers
throughout the garden, we spot two bronze statues of early British colonialists
stuck in time, playing their instruments in a crowd of people.

![friendship-garden-pce.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/friendship_garden_pce_b4f7d9fd16.webp)

My partner <em>also</em> enjoying some of the scenery and showing off her new [Winnie-the-Pooh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh)

shoulder bag that she got in [Shanghai Disneyland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Disneyland). ü§î

### Yong Qing Fang (The Museum of Cantonese Opera Art)

Built in 1931, this traditional and historical Cantonese Opera Theater is a time
capsule of artistry and cultural heritage that has existed in Guangzhou for
nearly a century with the help of continued restoration and maintenance since
the original constructed was completed. This theater is where [Bruce Lee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee) father
[Lee Hoi-cheun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hoi-chuen) had performed as a Cantonese opera actor.

![DSC_3473.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3473_eab7e26325.webp)

As we walked through the museum grounds, we were able to come just in time to
catch a traditional Cantonese opera performance. The stage was set against the
kind of lush greenery, water features and ponds that you would come to expect of
a Cantonese style garden. Though, a bit different from the previous garden we
visited, this was much more urban, with tall buildings surrounding you in every
direction.

![DSC_3508.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3508_f22abd8102.webp)

Tracing a path around the museum grounds that are shrouded by the walls
surrounding it, we saw more of the traditional flora and fauna as-well as rock
formations that submerge you in Guangzhou's rich culture and history. You almost
feel as if you've been transported back to 1931, if it weren't for the modern
buildings reminding you that you haven't left 2024.

![DSC_3472.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3472_5244fd21a2.webp)

From a higher level floor inside the museum you can over-see a tea house by the
pond where you could kick back and relax while taking in the performance on
stage.

![DSC_3500.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3500_e00a9187b1.webp)

Standing outside the Opera Museum, you're transported to what feels like a
traditional Chinese palace, an exclusive realm reserved for Cantonese Opera
royalty. ü•∏ The architecture captivates with its meticulous detailing, from the
grand scale of the building to the ornate roofing. Encountering such
craftsmanship is a rarity in the more urban landscapes of Guangzhou, making it a
unique and awe-inspiring experience.

### Bruce Lee's Ancestral Home (No. 13, Yongqing 1st Lane)

Making our way down the laneways of [Enning Road](https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/guangzhou/enning-road-15059032/),
located behind the Opera Museum, we arrive at what is (with some debate) said
to be Bruce Lee's ancestral home, where his father [Lee Hoi-cheun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hoi-chuen)
lived for for some time with his wife and son <em>(Bruce)</em> while
continuing his acting career.

![DSC_3510.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3510_a9a044845a.webp)
Bruce Lee was as much a philosopher as he was a martial artist practitioner.

Before [MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) was popularized, he created what would then be the style of [Jeet Kune Do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do).
With this it was also an amalgamation of [Zen Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) and [Taoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism)
philosophies, this influence becomes clear as you encounter this plaque
that is placed on your path as you walk towards the home. A reminder to be
focused on the things that matter, and to never restrict yourself to the point
you become in-flexible. He always placed a great importance on be adaptable,
both in his style of fighting, and ways of thinking.

![DSC_3511.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3511_2ca302c0a3.webp)

Just outside the front door we're met with the legendary martial artists [Ip Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man) and [Bruce Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee)
practicing [Wing Chun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun) with one another, a familiar scene if you've watched the [Ip Man films](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man_(film_series)>)
featuring [Donnie Yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Yen).

![DSC_3515-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3515_Enhanced_NR_4603d74532.webp)

The home features a front door crafted from black lacquered wood, while the
structure itself incorporates brick walls, wooden beams, and pillars. Inside,
intricate wood carvings are in line with the traditional [Xiguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiguan) [Shikumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikumen) style. In terms of layout, a small courtyard welcomes you at the entrance,
followed by a living room and a second courtyard housing the kitchen and back
gate. Aligned with the Shikumen architectural tradition, the house spans three
floors, with the second and third boasting individual balconies. The core
principle of this style emphasizes openness, achieved through tall roofs,
room-dividing screens, and a focus on optimal ventilation and natural light. The
color scheme adheres to customary choices, with red symbolizing good fortune and
black representing both protection and a connection to water.

![DSC_3517-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3517_Enhanced_NR_153ebad8ab.webp)

A stairway to heaven so to speak... ü§î Very steep, with the second and third
floors leading to the balconies where you can enjoy some fresh air away from the
central courtyard. It was a bit emptier than I was expecting, and it <em>did</em> look like it was in need of some maintenance, but it was still cool to
check out a traditional Shikumen style home ‚Äî it really was like walking into a
different world. A bit of a departure from the [faux federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_architecture#Federation_Revival) home I grew up in.

### Quick Family Meal...

Before leaving Guangzhou, we had one final dinner with my partners family!
Everything from sashimi, scallops, lobster, pigeon and crumbed fried beef... I
tried a bit of everything but fair to say I was a fan of the beef with its zesty
orange juice sauce üôà

![family-meal-1.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/family_meal_1_bf7a9a5228.webp)

See you next time Guangzhou! üëã

## Hong Kong (3 Days)

Our last stop on our journey was over to [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong)
by high-speed rail. Before coming over here, I had always heard about the
small narrow streets, and restaurants hidden away in small alleyways that might
make you feel <em>slightly</em> claustrophobic, but with food that would be
worth dying for. The visual of an expansive skyline, split down the middle by [Victoria Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour)
was something I've always wanted to see with my own two eyes.

![DSC_3984.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3984_8b0648f696.webp)

We started the trip by checking into our tiny <strong>11 square meter</strong> hotel
room which we would be staying in for the next two nights. Great if you love to
get nice and cosy! üòÜ

### Lung Fu Shan Morning Trail

The first thing on our agenda in Hong Kong was heading up the [Lung Fu Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_Fu_Shan) Morning Trail that was looking the North Western part of Hong Kong, it was
a popular little spot and good excuse to stretch the legs and burn off some of
the food we had been eating for the last week. ü´É

![DSC_3998-2.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_3998_2_1ff7099fe1.webp)

We cut through the [University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hong_Kong)
to make our way up steep hills, where we found the starting point for the
hike that would give us some good opportunities to get a better look at Hong
Kong from up high.

![DSC_4000.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4000_7849aa6596.webp)

Overlooking the skyline of North West Hong Kong, you can see the rolling hills
surrounding the city, as-well the [International Commerce
Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commerce_Centre), a colossal
108-storey skyscraper, that comes alive at night. It is the only building in
Hong Kong that is over 100-storeys, and is the 10th tallest building in the
world, measured by number of floors.

![DSC_4045.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4045_16f714eade.webp)

A closer look at the [International Commerce Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commerce_Centre)
as it towers over [West Kowloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kowloon_Cultural_District)
and the nearby [Hong Kong Palace Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Palace_Museum).

![DSC_4117-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4117_Enhanced_NR_ff60af1f94.webp)

At night the vibrant neon lights of ships docked along the waterfront, and mix
of white and orange hues from residential and commercial buildings add to the
picturesque view of the cities skyline. In the foreground, you can see the next
two tallest buildings behind the <strong>International Commerce Centre</strong>,
the [Central Plaza](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Plaza_(Hong_Kong)>) building on the left, and the [International Finance Centre](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Centre_(Hong_Kong)>)
building on the right. The areas they stand today is on land that had been
reclaimed from [Victoria Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour)
in the 1970's. To put it into perspective, the <strong>Central Plaza</strong> building was the tallest building in Asia from 1992 until 1996, until
the [Shun Hing Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shun_Hing_Square0)
was built in [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), neighboring Hong Kong.

![DSC_4167.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4167_0bd5caba6b.webp)

The [International Commerce
Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commerce_Centre) at night
puts on a show with various patterns and images projected from the side of the
building out to the rest of city. I had to hunker down for quite a while to grab
this shot, as it rotates through around 10 combinations of images, and it was a
bit of a chilly night! But enduring the chills were worth the wait. ü•∂

![DSC_4095-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4095_Enhanced_NR_d3c59ac562.webp)

With the hike up finished we picked up some bubble tea and an [egg waffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_waffle)
on [Victoria Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Peak), egg waffles are very popular in Hong Kong and [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau).
We got them from the little shopping area that connects up with the [Peak Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Tower) where you can get a first class
view of the city. It was a bit too busy for
our liking though, so we stuck to the paths on the trail.

![DSC_4266.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4266_641378a9bf.webp)

On the way down we get one last shot of the skyline near the trail, admiring the
density of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline. This was our last sight
for the night, before we squeezed ourselves back into the tiny little hotel
room. üëüüì¶

### Ngong Ping Village (Ngong Ping Big Buddha &amp; Po Lin Monastery)

For our final full day in Hong Kong, we head over to [Lantau Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantau_Island)
where we need to reach [Ngong Ping Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngong_Ping_360) by cable car.

![DSC_4297.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4297_9b8d9fe1e6.webp)

Heading up to Ngong Ping Village aboard one of the [Ngong Ping 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngong_Ping_360) cable cars, you get a great
aerial view of [Tung Chung] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung) where the
tall buildings almost look out of place as they're wedged between the calm coast
line and the mountains that make even the sparse, large residential buildings
look small.

![DSC_4321.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4321_149f0e5060.webp)

As you journey further through the hills of Lantau, you'll catch sight of the [Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Zhuhai%E2%80%93Macau_Bridge)
and the man-made island that links Hong Kong and Macau to [Zhuhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai)
through an extensive undersea tunnel. This bridge, connecting major cities
in the [Pearl River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta)
region of China, holds the distinction of being both the longest sea
crossing and the lengthiest open-sea fixed link in the world.

![DSC_4355.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4355_ff8689f17d.webp)

Finally arriving in the village you can spot a glimpse of the [Big Buddha](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Buddha_(Hong_Kong)>)
that immediately catches your attention as you touch down here. Like
clockwork, we pick up some more bubble tea to fuel our day around the area,
while checking out some of the surrounding gift shops. üßã

![DSC_4362.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4362_16ed06dca4.webp)

Making our way further up we see signs warning you about the local wild Ox that
make their way around the area, advising to avoid touching them. They were
fairly friendly and definitely weren't shy about getting their photos taken
though. üì∏üêÇ

![DSC_4763.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4763_e3a4418b9d.webp)

The stairs to the bronze statue equate to 268 in total, with the size of the
actual Buddha being 34 m (112 ft) in height and weighing in at over 250 metric
tons. Contrasting it with the scale of visitors walking up each flight of stairs
makes you realise the magnitude of such a monument. But we're not waking our way
up to the top just yet, we have one stop to make first.

![DSC_4758.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4758_037bcd35e3.webp)

After admiring the giant bronze statue of the Buddha from a distance, we decide
to investigate [Po Lin Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_Lin_Monastery)
first. Adorned with lanterns outside the entrance, and throughout the
temple grounds, the smell of incense catches you and pulls you in. The area
surrounded by not much other than trees and a few small shops for tourists, the
monastery stands out, peaking its head out from above the canopy.

![DSC_4386.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4386_4afecba2fb.webp)

Strolling through the temple grounds, we come across the main shrine hall, originally completed in 1970. If you look closely through the doorways,
you can catch glimpses of one of three Buddhas gracing the space: [Buddha AmitƒÅbha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha),
[Buddha Bhaisajyaguru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaisajyaguru), and [Buddha Shakyamuni](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-asia/beginners-guide-asian-culture/buddhist-art-culture/a/the-buddha-shakyamuni)
‚Äì the latter being the Chinese name for Buddha.

![DSC_4392.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4392_252b5bc7d9.webp)

Continuing our exploration around the rear of the main shrine hall, we encounter
The Grand Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas. While access inside this three-story
temple is restricted, we take a moment to quietly appreciate the intricate
details and classical Song dynasty architecture. Functioning primarily as a
meditation hall, it serves various other purposes, including exhibitions, a
shrine, and a scripture library. The golden Buddhas immediately capture our
attention, glistening in gold with contrasting black hair. And yet, the thought
lingers ‚Äì where might the other 9,995 be hiding? üßê

![DSC_4414.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4414_b59936d9a7.webp)

With the morning coming to a close we head to the top of the Big Buddha, where
he sits atop his lotus throne on a three-platform altar. The construction
concluded on October 13, 1989, with the placement of the final bronze piece. The
right hand is uplifted, symbolizing the removal of affliction, while the left
hand rests on his lap in a gesture of generosity. The base upon which it sits is
modeled after a similar one located at the [Temple of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Heaven)
in Beijing. Inside we found three different floors, each filled with
Buddhist relics, scriptures and shrinesÔºçthough photography inside the Buddha
was prohibited. It's on the third floor that you can get a bit closer to him,
overlooking the rest of the surrounding area.

![DSC_4418.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4418_aef8fb6df1.webp)
From the base of the Big Buddha, the expansive view unfolds over the towering
trees, offering a broader perspective of the surrounding mountains that embrace
Ngong Ping village. This panoramic scene provides insight into the calm and
secluded lifestyle sought by many monks who come here for meditation and
worship.

### Tai O Fisherman Village

For our next trip located near Ngong Ping Village, we take a bus ride over to
the neighbouring [Tai O Fishmerman Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_O). The ride there was interesting, twisting and swerving through narrow roads in
a long passenger bus, the driver making me at times sweat as he would brush up
against some of the branches from the surrounding trees perching over the road.
It felt like it could turn into a scene from [Final Destination](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination_(film)>)at any second. üíÄ

![DSC_4428.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4428_54001420b9.webp)

Fortunately, we arrived in one piece! Our first view of Tai O Village, Hong
Kong's oldest fishing village; many stilted houses and buildings all of which
looking like they've been here for the last 50 years or more. In some ways it
reminds me of the time I spent growing up in [Gippsland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gippsland), where small towns lined the waterfront, and though it's not as busy as the
city, you get a feel for the intimate connections people who live here have with
each other. The town itself is at-least three centuries old, having been
occupied briefly by the Portuguese in the 16th Century, until they were
eventually defeated and the town was reclaimed. Stories have it that it was
commonly used as a base of operating for smuggling and pirating, and it
definitely gives off those vibes. üè¥&zwj;‚ò†Ô∏è

![DSC_4432.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4432_dca01da4b6.webp)

A lonely fisherman going about his daily routine. The expansive open ocean makes
you contemplate just many fish there might be hidden away, waiting to be caught.
ü§î I hope he got a good haul that day! üòåüôè

![DSC_4611.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4611_cd4a2e15cc.webp)
Cutting through the town center you can see dried fish strung up, the smell
permeating through the air with each step, it hard to escape! ü´¢ At-least one
restaurant is nestled here, but it's predominantly local small shops selling
various ranges of fish and small knick-knacks. I will mention though, they did
have a really delicious and juicy mango mochi snack. If you make your way here,
highly recommended... If you can find it! üòè
![DSC_4630.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4630_770d505154.webp)

Snow White and the Seven Dwarves on display in one of the narrow alleys. Looks
like they've been hung out to dry Ôºç if you're a prince charming in the area,
inquire with within about Snow White needing a new spouse! üòú

![DSC_4622-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4622_Enhanced_NR_f194daafb7.webp)

There's a trendy little store decked out with various lanterns and neon signs.
While we didn't check out the inside, I can appreciate the unique decor ‚Äî
definitely a unique little spot compared to the more "ordinary" shops in the
area. ‚úåÔ∏è

![DSC_4441.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4441_005c95e9af.webp)

While traveling around we hopped onto one of the small tour boats you can cruise
around the town in, getting a slightly unique perspective. Different sides of
the town are connected by bridges over the waterfront, it's odd to think that
the only thing holding them up are the stilts underneath them. Seeing a town
standing over water isn't something that I had seen before coming here. How does
the plumbing work? ü§î Hmm...

![DSC_4635.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4635_b77f7c6dec.webp)

Turning around you get to see the enormous mountains towering over this small
little fishing village. When we were in Ngong Ping village, we were sitting
slightly higher up so the scale didn't hit you as hard as when you descend down
to the waterfront.

![DSC_4526.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4526_8c16d16a97.webp)

Heading out into the [South China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea) you can watch the coast pass
by, and in the distance I spot a little oriental pavilion in seemingly
no-whereÔºçhow strange.

![DSC_4508.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4508_e1dd4be5b9.webp)

While sightseeing we catch a glimpse of a <strong>Pink Dolphin</strong> going
about its afternoon swim! It's a bit tricky to tell its pink hue from this
distance, but rest assured these dolphins are local celebrities around Lantau
Island. Their numbers have been decreasing in recent years, [some sources](https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/con_mar/con_mar_chi/con_mar_chi_chi/files/Final_Report_2021_22.pdf)
estimate a decline from around 158 in 2003 to about 40 in 2022. It's
disheartening to hear, but hopefully, there are conservation efforts underway to
ensure the preservation of these graceful and intelligent creatures in the
future. üê¨

![DSC_4575.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4575_3dc9a1c2c3.webp)

Here we have some local fishermen setting up for the afternoon by the rocks just
off-shore. It must be nice to leave your house, pick up a rod, and be ready to
catch some lunch in just a few minutes. üé£

![DSC_4661.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4661_e324da6a8f.webp)

Losing our sea legs, we jump back on-to land and head towards the North end of
the island that's mostly uninhabited with the exception of a few small shops and
a few other facilities like a hospital/clinic and school. Walking through here
we run into an abandoned building, it looks almost like an old school that's
been reclaimed by nature. Seeing how the Earth intertwines with man-made
structures is always somewhat captivating. It's almost like an arc deco piece in
its own right, except with no human intervention. üèöÔ∏èüåø

![DSC_4700.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4700_83bb3b8ef8.webp)

Further along the coast we find one of the locals drying some fish paste and
prawns in the hot sun, likely to sell later at one of the village . ‚òÄÔ∏è It really
reminds you that you're walking through a fishing village ‚Äì not just the sight
of it, but the smell too. üòÇ

![DSC_4681.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4681_8dfe42da48.webp)

As we make our way towards the end of the island and look behind us, with the
sun starting its descent toward the Earth, the mountains looming tall over the
village, tour boats continue to run like clockwork, on the lookout for more
photogenic pink dolphins. It was an immensely unique place to visit, in
Melbourne we have many coastal side towns with fishing piers, but seldom do we
see a village suspended over the ocean, seamlessly connected from one side to
the other.

### Victoria Harbour (Ferry)

As our Hong Kong adventure comes to a close, we spend our last night exploring
the vibrant cityscape and harbour before heading back to Guangzhou. Hopping on
the metro, we make our way towards the iconic [Victoria Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour).

This massive stretch of water separates Hong Kong in the south from the [Kowloon Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Peninsula)
in the North. Its deep and sheltered waters are a key reason why this area
has had such a large impact in international trade, commerce and its
establishment as a British Colony in 1841.

![DSC_4830-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4830_Enhanced_NR_f6b5cf65b7.webp)

As we arrive at [Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ferry_Pier,_Tsim_Sha_Tsui) we board one of the [Star Ferries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ferry)
that patrol the harbour, we get to see the city from a different a
different angle, and can spot the [Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Convention_and_Exhibition_Centre)
jutting out from the waterfront. The HKCEC sits atop reclaimed land where
it was constructed between 1985 to 1988, only taking four years in total to
complete from the initial reclaiming of land, to the construction of the
building itself.

![DSC_4819-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4819_Enhanced_NR_3424e6c210.webp)

A more distinct ferry appears on the harbour, as I write this I couldn't ID it
as belonging to the Star Ferry fleetÔºça ghost ship perhaps? üëª Off to the side
we can see the [Hong Kong Observation
Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Observation_Wheel)Ôºçthis is the
same one we could see making our way up to the top of Victoria Peak! Initially I
mistook it for some sort of theme park. ü§¶&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è The neon colors flowing out
into the harbour from the surrounding lights are magical, makes me wish I lived
in the city. Soon, Ash, soon... ü§£

![DSC_4812-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4812_Enhanced_NR_9ec8adbd68.webp)

This time viewing the HKCEC from a bit further away, you can see the lights from
surrounding buildings shooting into the air. You could nearly think that
Godzilla would come stomping through any minute. ü¶ñ

![DSC_4815-Enhanced-NR.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4815_Enhanced_NR_ce2d5630b5.webp)

Seeing the different types of boats driving around the harbour was a cool sight,
all adorned with their own lights and at-least one with a party aboard, I can
see they're still in the Christmas spirit early in January. üéÑ

![DSC_4835.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4835_d38f821572.webp)

We once again set our sea-legs aside and hop off to Central Pier 8, located near
the Observation Wheel (which you can see sticking out), opposite Kowloon. There
are 10 piers total on this side of the the harbour, all lining the same stretch
of waterfront no more than a few meters apart.

![DSC_4837.webp](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/DSC_4837_40240fd30e.webp)

Before heading off back to Tsim Sha Tsui for the night I spot Elon in the corner
of my eye. ü§î Looks like someone in Hong Kong is out to make some money from his
Dogecoin empire. ü§¥

## One Last Stop... üöÖ

Ok, ok... I'm getting there. ü§£ Before heading back to Australia we had to jump
back over to Guangzhou as our flight was from Guangzhou Airport.

![Sichuan chicken with a lot of red chilli](https://at-strapi-blog.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sichuan_chicken_813f755fd8.webp)
To send us on our way me and my partner had some Sichuan food at [Ease
(Yuexiu)](https://guide.michelin.com/en/guangdong-province/guangzhou/restaurant/ease-yuexiu)
with a few of her friends that live in her city. As is typical of Sichuan food
it packed a little bit of a punch. I even got to have a dish I <em>always</em> crave,
and order, back at homeÔºçSichuan chicken! ü•µ

## Heading Home üõ´

That's all for my first trip to China! There was a few details and bits and
pieces left out, but I tried to keep everything that I thought either looked
cool, or was a unique experience. All in all, it was an enormous effort to sift
through over <strong>3000 photos</strong>, edit a few hundred and put this final
blog post together. These are just a few of the stories that made the cut, so
hope you enjoyed following me along into China, learned something new and might
even considering adding it on-to your bucket list. üá®üá≥ I'm hoping to have a bit
more of a countryside trip next time around, so be sure to check back next
yearÔºçyou might get to see a Panda or two! üêº Or sooner if you want to learn
about some trends in tech, or little tid-bits about web dev. üòâ
