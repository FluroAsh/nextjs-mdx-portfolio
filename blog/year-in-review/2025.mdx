Well boy howdy, 2025 is now behind us, and with 2026 here, tis the season for New Years resolutions and looking back at the year that was.

As my first task of 2026, I want to start setting an annual tradition of looking back, and being a bit more intentional about reflecting on the last year, what has changed, who I've become, what I've learned and what I've achieved. As a bonus, it's also a great way to force myself to write more, as I've been slacking off on the blog a bit this year. 🤓

As the idealic introvert that I am, I think I speak for most of us when I say that it's quite easy to not give yourself credit for the things you've done, and the progress you've made, no matter how small. I've made some great progress in 2025, and I'm proud of what I've achieved, the kind of person, as-well as engineer I'm becoming as I gear up for 2026.

## What I'm changing

As part of my New Years resolutions, I really want to start treating my time more like a precious resource, not wasting it on things that don't align with my goals and aspirations. This means cutting down on that Netflix time, avoiding background noise and distractions, and really doing my best to lock in and focus when I set aside the time to learn something new, work on those side projects I've been putting off, or just go deeper into a topic I'm interested in.

The idea is to do this without going off the deep end and cutting out all fun stuff, I'll still be playing some of the ol' video games, kicking back with TV shows, movies (still need to watch the Godfather Trilogy 😬) and reading more books, the point is to simply be more intentional with my time and energy, rather than letting jesus take the wheel.

## What is driving me

I'm now entering into a different stage of life, the 30's milestone! Both exciting and also a bit frightening, I think of it as the "crossroad" decade. It's around this time I believed I would have my life together, and I mostly have, I've got my own place to call home, a pretty stable relationship and supportive partner, and a job working in the field I'm passionate about, and while I've made some pretty big strides, I'm really looking forward to working on and refining those areas where I feel I'm holding my self back, mostly due to lack of kindness for myself.

A lot of 2025 for me was layered with anxiety, thoughts of "am I doing the right thing here?", "why am I not able to articualte myself on the spot?", mostly stemming from some degree of insecurity.

A part of my personality is when I make these feelings known, either through verbal or written communication, it gets me fired up and more attentive to these markers that I would otherwise let sit idle until they resurface. A key routine I'll be introducing is regular journalling to make sure I'm consciously focusing on these things, and working to be squeeze out the things that aren't serving me positively in life, and amplifying the good.

A bonus is I also actually _do_ enjoy the process of writing, but I often let myself become too "busy" with procrastinating, or obsessing over trying to optimise for growth.

## Health & Fitness

Body and mind... I've really keyed into the importance of some good ol' fashioned sunshine towards the end of 2025. I've started running regularly again towards the end of last year, which has really helped me start feeling more active, rather than just embracing the "gym bro" lifestyle, which was made up of effectively 0 cardio, and 3-4 body builder splits a week.

Focusing on improving general cardiovascular health has made my body feel more energetic, alive and more importantly, less lethargic — goodbye post-dinner naps! This is a trend I want to carry forward, and really amplify going into 2026, starting with at-least 2 runs a week, bumping up the v02 max, and working up to some longer distance running. Maybe a short marathon by EOY? 🤔 Let's see... Start small, finish big. 😎

Of course, this little change I've started in 2025, has also been a good way to carve our some intentional time away from tech, I find my thoughts stay busy even when I'm in the house, so quieting those little voices down, and making room for some new ones has been an overall net positive for the mental health. 🧠

## Travel & Experiences

Earlier in the year, I flew off to Japan for a 2-week adventure, exploring the cities of Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and finishing in Kawaguchiko, a small town located near the base of mount Fuji. This was my first time visiting Japan, as a huge anime and manga fan and food it was one of the best trips I've been on, I highly recommend if you're interested in sharing the experience you read about it in my Japan 2025 series, starting with [Tokyo](https://www.ashleygthompson.com/blog/japan-2025/tokyo).

## The Future (Aspirations for 2026 and beyond)

### Engineering Mentality

- Ask questions as a means of reducing entropy in the team
- Do not assume, ask questions, and do not feign knowledge or understanding as a means of false or performative seniority
- Stay curious, clarify, but know when to

### Fullstack Engineering

{/* TODO: Create your own "T" Shaped developer graphic, eg: */}
{/* - Frontend (Depth) */}
{/* - Design */}
{/* - Backend */}
{/* - Cloud/Networking */}
{/* - IoT */}
{/* - AI */}

- Focusing on the "T" shaped developer pathway
- I've been finding greater interest in broadening my knowledge in backend, infrastructure and other technical topics outside the frontend sphere
- I've learned that I am more likely to commit to learning and be consistent when I spread my attention across different domains
  - In 2026, I want to focus on reinforcing this mindset and applying it to areas I've recently been taking an interest in:
    - Backend
    - Infrastructure
    - DevOps & Cloud
    - Electronics (IoT & Hardware)
- With my little homelab setup, I'm planning to really focus on a deeper understanding of the tools and technologies that power the web, and how my
  humble home server can be used for a force multiplier for my personal and professional life, rather than just a glorified media server.
