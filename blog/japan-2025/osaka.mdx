## Osaka (3 days)

- Checkout from our hotel
- Breakfast at granny's cafe
- Carried our luggage and headed to Gion-shijo station
- Took the train towards **Kyobashi**
- Switched to the **Osaka Metro Tanimachi** subway, getting off at **Higashi-Umeda**
- Walked from Higashi-Umeda to **Umeda station**, taking the **Midsouji Line** to **Nippombashi** station
- Finally, after lots of switching, we arrived at our stop.
- We walked to our hotel which was about a 10 minute walk from the station
- Stored our luggage at the hotel before check-in
- Went for lunch at a nearby Soba restaurant
  - [Teuchisoba Shuhari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PhiVkN52zLrBiuVJ8)
  - They specialise in buckwheat soba noodles served either hot or cold
  - We ordered some for ourselves, and as we couldn't get enough of it, a side of tempura to go with it!
- Afterwards we went across the street to have a look at the nearby [Kuromon Ichiba Market](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4031.html) which is well known as one of the most famous food markets in Osaka,
  where can find almost any type of food you can think of, from fresh seafood to grilled meats and local fruits.
- While walking through, we find some interesting looking white strawberries, which were quite expensive, so we paid our tourist tax and bought a skewer to try them out.
  - To be honest, they were a bit underwhelming after hearing about how good Japan's fruits are, they sort of just tasted liek normal strawberries, but just had a very different appearance. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - They might not have been in season yet, as it was still early in the year, so we might have to try them again next time we visit Japan! üçì
- After having a short walk around the market, we head back to the hotel to check in and take the luggage upstairs into our room.
- Our room was on one of the higher floors, overlooking one of the busy streets in Osaka, it reminded me a bit of the streets of Tokyo, being raised above the ground and winding between buildings.

### "New World" District

{/* Tsutenkaku */}

- Having settled in, we make our way towards [Shinsekai "New World" District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsekai),literally meaning "New World" in Japanese, is a vibrant and
  nostalgic district in Osaka, known for its retro atmosphere, giant 3D signboards and unique blend of old and new.
- The district's sotuhern area was modelled after New York, specifically [Coney Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island), with mixtures of Western and Japanese culture.
- The northern part of the district being modelled after Paris, with the iconic [Tsutenkaku Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutenkaku) (ÈÄöÂ§©Èñ£) being the main attraction of the area, partially inspired
  by the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
  - The tower itself was originally built in 1912, but was severely damaged by a fire in 1943, being disassembled and used for steel during the war effort, later being rebuilt in 1956, becoming a symbol of Osaka's post-war recovery and growth.
- We took time to walk through the streets of Shinsekai, checking out the various shops, stalls and restaraunts in the southern end of the district, before making our way towards the Tsutenkaku Tower.
- The Tsutenkaku Tower is a symbol of Osaka, standing at 103 meters tall, and offers panoramic views of the city from its observation deck.
- We didn't go up to the observation deck this time, but instead opted to jump on the **tsutenkaku tower slide**
- You could instead do a "dive and walk" experience, when you walk up to the top of the tower, and then jump off one of the higher parts of the tower‚Äîwe could only choose one, so we went for the slide instead!
- The slide was a fun experience, the weight took at-least 45 minutes to get through, but the short little ride down was still a lot of fun, it makes you feel like a kid again! üõù
- After the slide, we headed back down into the streets of Shinsekai and started to think about what we wanted to gobble up for dinner!
- We ended up looking around for a place to eat, walking towards Dotonbori, ending up stumbling into a little gem of a restaraunt called [Fukutaro](https://2951.jp/en/#) which is famous for its okonomiyaki and negiyaki
  - Located just opposite **Kuromon Market**, this place _absolutely_ needs to be on your list if you're in Osaka! They have a few locations, but this is the main store.
  - Famous for **Negiyaki** ‚Äî a thinner, lighter, savory pancake with lots of Japanese green leeks, soy sauce-based flavoring, and either beef, pork or seafood. (I got the beef one, it was _TOO_ good!)
  - Cooking style: Griddles are in full view ‚Äî customers can watch chefs skillfully pour, flip, and plate the dishes right at the counter.
  - Atmosphere: Lively and intimate; seating is limited so expect queues during peak hours.
  - Popularity: Well-known among both locals and tourists, often ranked among the top okonomiyaki/negiyaki spots in Osaka.

### Dotonbori

{/* Dotonbori */}

- After wrapping up with dinner, we walked from Shinsekai to the famous [Dotonbori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori) district, which took about 15 minutes on foot, leading us to our next stop ‚Äî desert!
- Walking through the neon-lit streets of Dotonbori, and some similar signs to those in Shinsekai, we found a cute little **melonpan** shop, which is a popular Japanese sweet bread with a crunchy cookie crust on top, often
  filled with ice-cream of various flavours
  - We got ourselves one to share, going for the _limited editon_ sakura (cherry blossom) flavour, which was a soft pink colour and had a subtle floral taste to it, it kind of just tasted like a slightly floral strawberry, it was really good! üå∏
- Osaka Wonder Loop cruise
  - We hopped on the Osaka Wonder Loop cruise, which is a boat tour that takes you along the Dotonbori canal, giving you a unique perspective of the district from the water.
  - The cruise lasts about 20 minutes and takes you under the famous Dotonbori **Dotonbori Ebisu Bridge** and past the iconic **Glico** sign, which is a famous landmark in Osaka.
  - The boat takes you right under the bridge, close enough that you could reach out and touch the bridge, if you staff hadn't warned us not to in advance... üëÄ
  - You'll also see a few other famous landmarks, such as the **Don Quijote Ferris wheel** and
  - The whole strip of Dotonbori comes alive at night with neon lights, reflecting off the water and creating a blanerunner-esque atmosphere ‚Äî it's something you'll find difficult to find anywhere else in the world!
- Quick stop at the nearby giant **Don Quijote** store to grab some snacks and souvenirs for our flight home
- Carrying our snack haul, we headed back to the hotel to prepare for tomorrows trip to Nara

### Nara

- Did the usual iced coffee run to a nearby 7/11
- Boarded the special [Narashika-themed Kintetsu Line train](https://fromjapan.info/kintetsurailway-topics-about-explore-the-beauty-of-nara-and-its-surroundings-with-a-cute-narashika-train/) from Kintetsu-Nippombashi Station to Kintesu-Nara Station
- Walked from Kintetsu-Nara Station to [Higashimuki Shopping Street](https://www.visitnara.jp/venues/S01128/)
- Stopped by a cosy little izakaya style restaraunt called [Kamaiki](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298198-d3817383-Reviews-Kamaiki-Nara_Nara_Prefecture_Kinki.html) for lunch which
  is quite well known for their homemade noodles which are freshly cut and boiled every morning, typically served with a side of tempura
  - I went for the udon and side of shrimp tempura, while Yuki went for the chicken karaage, udon and crab tempura
- We then grabbed some special Nara soy doughnuts from [Floresta Narahonten](https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Restaurant_Review-g298198-d1697792-Reviews-Floresta_Narahonten-Nara_Nara_Prefecture_Kinki.html) and
  sat down to enjoy them with a hot coffee ‚Äî they were so good, we ended up getting seconds! üç©
- Headed over to the Nara Deer Park
- Bought some deer crackers (got harassed)
- Made our way along the walking path to Kasuga Taisha latern path
  - Along the way we saw many deer lurking around the lanterns, watching us as we continued walking‚Äîyou could feel their eyes on you, it was obvious they were hoping for some food
    from us, as we weren't locals in their terriority!
  - Kasuga Taisha (Êò•Êó•Â§ßÁ§æ) is a Shinto shrine in Nara, Japan, famous for its many bronze lanterns that line the paths leading to the shrine.
- Checked out the [Todai-ji Daibutsuden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji) (Great Buddha Hall)
- Came back to say goodbye to the deers and head back to Osaka
- Dinner at Kura Sushi (ÂõûËª¢ÂØøÂè∏) ‚Äî a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain in Japan
  - We enjoyed playing the little game on our table where you can win a prize if you collect enough plates, but we got absolutely scammed! üòÇ
  - We ate a total of 15 plates, with 3 attempts and nothing in return, I being stubborn and trying to win something pushed us up to 20 plates for one last attempt
  - But even that wasn't enough, so we left empty handed, our consolation prize was leaving with full stomachs! ü´É
