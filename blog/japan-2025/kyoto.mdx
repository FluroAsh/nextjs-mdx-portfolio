## Kyoto (3 days)

{/* Day 1 */}

- The next morning we checked out and were off to Kyoto by Shinkansen from Tokyo station
- Fortunately for me, we managed to book ahead and bag the Mt. Fuji seats on the Shinkansen, which meant we had a great view of the mountain as we passed by it on our way to Kyoto! üóª
- We quickly grabbed some food for the train ride over, just some simple chicken sando's and coffee from one of the little konbini's in the station ‚Äî at this point I really wish we had
  these sandwiches back home in Australia. üò≠
- Once the train departed, we settled in for the ride, and opened up our packed lunches as we were going to be pretty strapped from time once we arrived in Kyoto.
- About a 2 hour ride later onboard the [Nozomi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nozomi_(train)>) Shinkansen, we finally arrived at Kyoto station
- We hopped off the train and made our way to the Kyoto City Bus terminal, which was conveniently located right next to the station.

### Kiyomizu-dera

- We were off towards the famous [Kiyomizu-dera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizu-dera) (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ÂØ∫) temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most celebrated temples in Japan.

  - We took the Kyoto City Bus from Kyoto Station to Kiyomuzu-dera directly, which was about a 15 minute ride.
  - Getting off at [Gojozaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%8Dzaka) bus stop, with luggage in hand, we made our way towards the Kimono rental shop to pick up our outfits for the day.

- Kimono rental

  - The local kimono rental shop was called [MOCOMOCO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LWH9KkvsdwrfPiBc7), which is about a 10 minute walk from Kiyomizu-dera, and 2 minutes from
    Gojo-dori street which is filled with snack shops and little cafes.
  - On the way we grab some ice-cream soda and mochi, I was having dangerous amounts of sugar, but when in Japan... üòÖ

- Kiyomizu-dera Temple
- The name "Kiyomizu" means "clear water" in Japanese, and the temple is named after the Otowa Waterfall, which runs beneath the main hall.
- The temple is famous for its wooden stage that juts out over the hillside, offering stunning views of the cherry blossoms in spring and the vibrant foliage in autumn.
- The main hall (Hond≈ç) is built without the use of nails, showcasing traditional Japanese wooden architecture.
- Kiyomizu-dera is also known for its "Kannon" deity, the goddess of mercy, and many visitors come to pray for good fortune and health.
- The temple complex includes several other shrines, pagodas, and gardens, making it a popular destination for both tourists and locals.
- The approach to the temple is lined with charming streets filled with traditional shops, tea houses, and stalls selling local crafts and snacks.
- Kiyomizu-dera is one of the most photographed landmarks in Kyoto, especially during the cherry blossom season when the temple is surrounded by blooming sakura trees
  - Which just so happens to be the time we were visiting! üå∏
- Sanju-no-to (Three-story pagoda)
- After spending the day exploring the temple, shops and getting a few snacks, we finally made our way back to the bus stop at Gojozaka, to catch a different bus that would take us to [Shijo Kawaramachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pQ78hS3dFW9yA3N48) right on **Kawaramachi Street**
  which was about a 5 minute walk to our hotel, [Kabin Kyoto](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298564-d28717057-Reviews-Kabin_Kyoto-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html).
- By the time we arrived at **Shijo Kawaramachi**, the sun was already starting to set, and the streets were starting to fill with people heading our for dinner and do some last minute shopping.
- The sunset was stunning, with the sky paints in hues of orange and pink, reflecting off the buildings and creating a day to remember for our first day in Kyoto.

{/* Hotel check-in */}

- Once we arrived at our hotel, we were greeted by the friendly staff who helped us check in, they were very friendly and must have been expats from other countries, as they seemed very familiar with the area, spoke perfect English
  and were very helpful in giving us recommendations for places to see and eat at during our few days in Kyoto.
- Our hotel room was _MUCH_ bigger than our previous one in Asakusa, it felt like a palace in comparison! ü§¥
- With our luggage droppedd off, we freshed up and headed out to find some dinner, I had a bit of a craving for some Japanese sashimi & nagiri, so we set out to [Sushiro](https://akindo-sushiro.co.jp/en/) („Çπ„Ç∑„É≠„Éº) ‚Äî a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain in Japan
  - The one we visited was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, down some stairs in the basement level. We just had to take a ticket, find a seat and wait for our number to be called.
  - It was fairly busy, which was a good sign, but people were moving through the line quite quickly, so my grumbling stomach didn't have to wait too long! üòÖ
  - We were seated down at a bench right beside the conveyor belt, and enjoyed the variety of sushi and sashimi, it was the freshest we had while in Japan, and easily the best value for money! üç£
  - I yoinked myself an alcoholic grape soda to wash it all down üçá I was so sad that I never got a chance to have this again, we couldn't find it anywhere!
  - It was basically a strong zero, but with grape syrup instead of lemon, and it was so good! üò≠
  - Coffee + crepes for desert
  - Highly, highly, highly recommend Sushiro if you're in town for some sushi, it was a really good balance of quality and price, and they often run seasonal specials & partnerships With
    well known anime and games, which is cool if you're into that culture! üòº
- ... ??
- Back to the hotel!

{/* Day 2 */}

### Heian-Jingu Shrine & Garden

- We decided today is the day for Japanese Maccas, so we headed over to the nearest one in Kyoto, which was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel
- I grab myself the legendary Teriyaki Chicken burger, and I couldn't turn down the seasonal cherry blossom pie to pair with my coffee either! üå∏

- For our next stop over to [Heian-Jingu Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_Jing%C5%AB) (Âπ≥ÂÆâÁ•ûÂÆÆ) we quickly pick up some onigiri (rice balls) for
  lunch from one of the extremely popular little food stalls on Kawaramachi Street, of course we went for the top 5 most popular flavours, which seems to be
  a very common thing to do in Japan when it comes to food üòÇ Can't complain, it removes the need to use my noggin'‚Äîtrust the locals! Or tourists?... ü§î
- From Kawaramachi Steet, we hopped on the Kyoto City Bus to **Heian-Jingu Shrine**, getting off at the stop just outside [ROHM Theatre Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROHM_Theatre_Kyoto).
- Today just so happened that the day we visited there was seemingly a lot of students graduating from their classes. This area was a bit of a hotspot for students as it was nearby a few different academic
  institutions, including **Kyoto University** ‚Äî the theatre often being used for graduation ceremonies, with heaps of different areas for students to take photos in their graduation gowns.
- This seemed to align with Kyoto University's graduation ceremony day, which happens to be between April & March each year, right in the midst of cherry blossom season! üå∏
- We walked through the main entrance gate into the courtyard, which was opened up to the public
- We took this time to find a place to sit and enjoy our onigiri, only realising you're not actualyl meant to eat in the shrine grounds ü§´ It's quite difficult to find a place to BYO lunch and eat.
- After finishing our lunch, we head towards the booth in the courtyard to buy our tickets to enter the shrine and gardens
- The entrance fee was 600 yen per person, which included access to the gardens and the main shrine hall, however the shrine was under renovations, so you couldn't fully appreciate it, as there was tarps
  covering the outside of the building, and much of the interior.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gardens area, large pond, walkway to second pond and stepping stones
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Main iconic pond area, with the iconic wooden bridge which was used as a set piece in the famous movie "Memoirs of a Geisha"
- At various parts of the garden, you can find small transitory sections which reflect the concept of "Ma" (Èñì) ‚Äî the Japanese aesthetic of negative space, which is often used in traditional Japanese gardens to create a sense of tranquility and harmony.
- This emphasizes the importance of balance and simplicity in Japanese design, allowing the natural beauty of the surroundings to shine through, allowing time to slow down and appreciate the moment and surrodunings.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some cherry blossoms were on display, but mostly were still buds, not fully bloomed yet ‚Äî the weather was still a bit chilly at this point in our trip, causing them to be a bit late this year.
- After finishing up our
- ...
- Dinner at [Saryo Tesshin](https://tabelog.com/en/kyoto/A2601/A260202/26041180/) which was serving buckwheat soba noodles
  - I had soba which came with some very tender duck breast, accompanied by some freshly grated wasabi and a glass of beer on the side. üòè
- Heading back to the hotel, we stop at Nishiki Market (Èå¶Â∏ÇÂ†¥) to pick up a few more bites as Yuki was still a bit hungry (and she let me know it too! üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è)
  - Nishiki Market is a bustling food market in Kyoto, known for its wide variety of traditional Japanese foods and snacks.
  - We strolled through the narrow alleyways and caught a glimpse of some melon pan out of the corner of our eyes, matcha no less!
  - We couldn't resist, so we grabbed one to share and headed back to the hotel to rest our tired feet after a long day of exploring. üí§
